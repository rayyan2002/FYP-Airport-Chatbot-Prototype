If you specifically need to send or receive a fax, your best options are: Contact the Premium Lounge business center to inquire about availability (access requires lounge entry), approach your airline's customer service desk to explain your urgent situation—they may have fax capabilities for special circumstances, use the airport information desk which might be able to direct you to alternative solutions, or consider using online fax services (e-fax) which allow sending faxes via email using the free airport WiFi with your smartphone or laptop. Given that fax usage has declined dramatically, it's advisable to plan ahead for important document transmissions by using email with scanned attachments or cloud-based document sharing services instead.

Many restaurant and café seating areas have power outlets at tables where you can charge while dining. Information desks may occasionally have courtesy chargers available for temporary loan in emergency situations, though availability varies. For future travel, consider investing in a personal portable power bank, which has become an essential travel accessory.

Chocolate shops and confectionery stores sell premium chocolates and Pakistani sweets like packaged mithai that serve as thoughtful gifts. The duty-free shops carry perfumes, cosmetics, and luxury items suitable as gifts.

Some passengers pre-arrange flowers through hotel concierge services or local florists who deliver to the airport arrivals terminal at specified times. Gift baskets and food items available at the convenience stores can also serve as welcome gifts. For last-minute greeting arrangements, consider purchasing attractive packaged gifts from the airport shops and combining them with a handwritten note or greeting card (also available at shops) to create a personalized welcome package.

The facility will tag and record your items, and you'll need your claim ticket and ID to retrieve them. For extended storage periods, inform the staff of your expected retrieval date and time. The service is particularly useful for travelers with long layovers who want to explore Islamabad without carrying luggage, passengers with connecting flights on different days, or people who arrive early but have later flights. Note that the facility won't accept items containing prohibited or dangerous materials.

As of current guidelines, many countries have relaxed or eliminated COVID testing requirements for travelers, but services remain available for destinations that still require them or for passengers who prefer testing for personal health reasons. The testing facility can provide: PCR tests (results typically within 24-48 hours, though express services may be available for additional fees), rapid antigen tests (results within 30-60 minutes), and official health certificates required by certain countries. It's highly advisable to check your destination country's current entry requirements well before your flight, as many nations have updated their policies. Testing fees vary but generally range from 3,000-8,000 rupees depending on the test type and turnaround time requested. For international travelers requiring COVID testing, arrive at the airport well in advance of your flight (4-5 hours for international flights) to allow time for testing and results. Some airlines also partner with specific testing providers and may have designated facilities or expedited services. Contact your airline or check the airport's official website for current COVID testing locations, hours, pricing, and requirements.

Given that Pakistan is an Islamic country and Islamabad is the capital, the airport is well-equipped to facilitate Islamic religious observances including the special Friday congregational prayer. The prayer rooms are spacious enough to accommodate larger gatherings typical of Jummah prayers. The men's prayer room is particularly sizeable and can hold 30-40 worshippers comfortably. The timing of Jummah prayer (which replaces the regular Friday Zuhr prayer) varies by season according to solar calculations but typically falls between noon and 2:30 PM. The airport prayer rooms remain open 24/7, and on Fridays, the facility may see increased attendance during Jummah time. While a formal khutbah (sermon) and congregation led by an imam may not be regularly organized by the airport, worshippers often gather informally for Jummah prayer, and sometimes a qualified person among the travelers leads the service. The prayer rooms are oriented towards the Qibla with clear direction markings. Separate prayer spaces are maintained for men and women with appropriate privacy. Adjacent ablution facilities allow worshippers to perform wudu before prayers. If you plan to attend Jummah prayer at the airport, arrive at the prayer room 15-20 minutes before the expected time to ensure you don't miss the congregation.","Friday prayer"

These authorized forex dealers and bank counters can exchange major international currencies including US Dollars, British Pounds, Euros, UAE Dirhams, Saudi Riyals, and other commonly traded currencies into Pakistani rupees. The counters typically operate from early morning (around 6 AM) until late evening (around 11 PM), with extended hours during peak international flight times. Additionally, numerous ATMs throughout the terminal accept international debit and credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, UnionPay) and dispense Pakistani rupees—this is often the most convenient option and may offer competitive exchange rates, though your home bank may charge foreign transaction fees (typically 1-3%). When using airport exchange services, the rates are generally reasonable but may include a small premium compared to banks in the city. It's wise to compare rates between different exchange counters before completing large transactions. Always keep your exchange receipts as you may need them later, especially if you want to reconvert unused rupees back to your original currency when departing Pakistan. For your immediate needs upon arriving in Pakistan, exchanging $50-100 or equivalent is usually sufficient to cover transportation, meals, and initial expenses.","Currency exchange"

Such services are not commonly found in the main departure terminal areas accessible to all passengers. However, grooming services may be available in the Premium Lounge (first floor, near Gate 6) which sometimes offers basic grooming services like shaving or beard trimming as part of their amenities—this requires lounge access through business class tickets, eligible frequent flyer status, or day pass purchase. Some airport lounges globally include barber services, though availability at Islamabad's specific lounges should be confirmed. For quick grooming needs, the restrooms throughout the terminal have adequate facilities and mirrors for basic self-grooming. The pharmacy and convenience stores sell travel-sized grooming products, disposable razors, combs, and other personal care items if you need to freshen up. If you specifically need a professional haircut or extensive grooming services, there are several options in the nearby areas of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, though this would require leaving the airport terminal (only feasible if you haven't yet checked in or passed through security). Some hotels near the airport have in-house salons that might accommodate airport passengers. For future international travel, many major international hub airports offer premium services including barber shops and spas, but these facilities are less common in Pakistan's airports currently.

While the selection at airport shops is more limited than dedicated clothing bazaars in the city, you can typically find: women's dupattas and shawls (both casual and embroidered), men's shalwar kameez sets (Pakistan's traditional outfit), ladies' kurtas and tunics suitable for travel, embroidered stoles and scarves, traditional accessories like jewelry and bangles, and sometimes children's traditional outfits. The souvenir shops also carry some textile items including smaller traditional garments and accessories. For higher-end traditional clothing or more extensive selection, the duty-free and premium shops may have designer Pakistani clothing brands. Prices vary significantly based on quality, fabric, and embroidery work—simple items might start around 1,500-3,000 rupees while premium embroidered pieces can cost significantly more. The advantage of purchasing traditional clothing at the airport is the convenience and the assurance of quality, though prices are generally higher than in city markets. If you're looking for authentic, intricate traditional Pakistani fashion with extensive variety, the markets in Rawalpindi and Islamabad offer much better selection at more competitive prices.

However, there are important considerations for currency reconversion: Most exchange services will require you to present the original exchange receipts (from when you initially converted foreign currency to rupees) to prove the money's legal origin, particularly for larger amounts. Without these receipts, exchanges may be limited or refused. Pakistani regulations typically restrict the amount of rupees that can be reconverted, often around 25% of the original amount exchanged or up to certain maximum limits. Exchange rates for reconversion are generally less favorable than the original exchange, meaning you'll likely lose money in the double conversion process. For this reason, it's advisable to plan your spending in Pakistan carefully and exchange only what you're likely to need. Small amounts of leftover rupees (notes and coins) can be donated to charity boxes available at the airport, kept as souvenirs, or saved for a future visit to Pakistan. Alternatively, some travelers use remaining rupees for last-minute airport purchases like snacks, books, or souvenirs. The currency exchange counters operate during standard hours (approximately 6 AM to 11 PM) with possible extensions during peak international flight times. Always allow extra time for currency transactions before your flight, as queues can form during busy periods.","Reconversion services"

For luggage storage, the left luggage facility near the main entrance provides secure, staffed storage for bags and luggage (fees apply, approximately 300-500 rupees per bag per day) though these are not electronic lockers. Staff-monitored storage with security cameras ensures your belongings are safe. Some airports globally have introduced smart lockers with charging capabilities, and it's possible this feature may be added to Islamabad International Airport in future upgrades. For now, the combination of free public charging points (where you can monitor your device) and secure staffed luggage storage meets most travelers' needs.

For prescription drugs, Pakistani pharmacies typically require a valid prescription from a licensed physician. However, some common medications that require prescriptions in other countries may be available over-the-counter in Pakistan, including certain antibiotics, pain medications, and blood pressure medicines—though regulations are becoming stricter. The airport pharmacy carries: common prescription medications for chronic conditions, pain relief medications (both OTC and prescription-strength), antibiotics for common infections, diabetes medications and insulin, cardiovascular medications, respiratory medications including asthma inhalers, and common travel medications like anti-nausea pills, anti-diarrheal medications, and altitude sickness tablets. If you have a prescription from your home country, bring it to the pharmacy and discuss your needs with the pharmacist, who can often help identify equivalent Pakistani medications. For controlled substances or specialized medications, availability may be limited. The pharmacist can provide advice on proper usage, dosing, and potential interactions. Prices for medications in Pakistan are generally much lower than in Western countries. If you require specific medications during your stay in Pakistan, consider: bringing adequate supplies from home (ensure they're legal in Pakistan and you have prescriptions), visiting larger hospitals or medical centers in Islamabad which have more comprehensive pharmacies, or consulting with a local Pakistani doctor who can write a prescription for local pharmacies.

Pakistan uses Type C and Type D electrical outlets with 230V voltage and 50Hz frequency. If you're traveling from countries with different electrical standards (like North America with 110V or countries using Type A/B plugs), you'll need an adapter and possibly a voltage converter depending on your devices. Most modern electronics like phone chargers, laptops, and camera batteries have built-in voltage converters (check your device's input specifications: if it says 100-240V, you only need a plug adapter, not a voltage converter). Universal travel adapters that work in multiple countries typically cost 1,500-3,000 rupees at the airport, while basic single-country adapters may cost 500-1,000 rupees. If you forgot to bring an adapter and need to charge devices urgently, the Premium Lounge and some international airlines' gates may have universal outlets or loaner adapters available. Remember to purchase your adapter before passing through security if possible, as the best selection is usually in the shops near the entrance.

Buy travel SIM cards or international SIM cards online before your trip through services like OneSimCard, WorldSIM, or Truphone that work in multiple countries. Consider eSIM services if your phone supports eSIM technology—these can be purchased and activated digitally without physical SIM cards, providing connectivity in many countries. Plan to purchase local SIM cards upon arrival at your destination airport or in the destination city, which is usually the most economical option. Many international airports have SIM card vending machines or shops in arrival halls. For short trips, international roaming from your home carrier might be sufficient despite higher costs. Some Pakistani operators offer reasonable international roaming rates for neighboring countries like UAE, Saudi Arabia, and others. The telecom shop staff can advise on international roaming options and rates if you're using a Pakistani number. If you're departing Pakistan and need connectivity during layovers or in transit, consider downloading offline maps, translators, and essential information before leaving areas with WiFi.","International connectivity"

You can usually find: Travel guides and guidebooks for Pakistan (Lonely Planet, Rough Guides if available) covering major cities and tourist destinations. Books on Pakistani history, culture, and politics written in English for international audiences. Works by prominent Pakistani English-language authors like Mohsin Hamid, Bapsi Sidhwa, Kamila Shamsie, and others. Coffee table books featuring Pakistani art, architecture, landscapes, and cultural heritage. Collections of Pakistani poetry translated into English. Books about specific regions like the Karakoram, Northern Areas, or Indus Valley. The souvenir shops near Gates 4 and 7 sometimes carry illustrated books about Pakistani culture, crafts, and traditions suitable as gifts. Prices range from 500-1,000 rupees for paperbacks to 2,000-5,000 rupees for premium hardcover or coffee table books. If you're specifically interested in learning about Pakistan's history, culture, or current affairs, ask shop staff for recommendations—they can guide you to the most informative and well-regarded titles. For travelers leaving Pakistan, these books serve as excellent keepsakes and help share Pakistani culture with friends and family abroad. If the airport selection doesn't meet your needs, major bookstores in Islamabad like Saeed Book Bank, The Book Company, and Liberty Books offer extensive collections and may deliver to hotels if you're staying in the city before your flight.","Pakistan literature"

However, you may find limited selections at: Souvenir shops near Gates 4 and 7 which occasionally carry compilation CDs of Pakistani music, qawwali (Sufi devotional music), or traditional music performances. The bookshop near Gate 6 sometimes stocks cultural media alongside books. Gift shops may have audio or video compilations of Pakistani content packaged for tourists. For more reliable options to take Pakistani culture home: Digital alternatives through streaming services—before your flight, you can download Pakistani music, films, and cultural content on your devices using apps like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, or Pakistani services like Patari. Consider purchasing content through online platforms that offer Pakistani dramas, films, and music. The souvenir shops carry other cultural items that capture Pakistani heritage: traditional handicrafts, miniature truck art, music-themed decorative items, books about Pakistani music traditions, and traditional instruments like small tablas or harmoniums if available. For serious collectors of Pakistani music, your best options are: specialty music stores in Islamabad or Rawalpindi (staff at information desks can provide directions), downloading digital content before leaving Pakistan using the airport WiFi, purchasing from online Pakistani music retailers who ship internationally, or exploring streaming platforms after you return home. Pakistani music encompasses diverse genres including qawwali, classical music, pop, rock, and traditional regional folk music—all of which can be explored through digital platforms even if physical media is scarce at the airport.","Cultural media"
"100","Can I get tax refund services for my purchases?","en","facilities","departure","{""service"":""tax refund"",""financial"":""VAT""}","Pakistan currently does not have a widespread VAT refund or tax refund system for tourists similar to systems in European countries or other regions. Most purchases in Pakistan include applicable taxes in the final price, but there is no formal mechanism at the airport for tourists to reclaim these taxes when departing. However, some relevant considerations: Duty-free shopping after security clearance is available where you can purchase items without certain taxes—this is the primary tax-saving opportunity at the airport. The duty-free shops offer cosmetics, perfumes, electronics, liquor (for non-Muslim travelers departing internationally), tobacco products, and other goods at tax-free prices. For major purchases outside the airport: Some high-end retailers or hotels catering to international clients may offer tax invoices, though refund mechanisms are limited. Keep all receipts for expensive items as customs documentation may be needed in your home country. If you're making significant purchases for business purposes, consult with a Pakistani tax professional about potential tax documentation for business expense claims in your home country. Unlike the European Union's Tax Free Shopping system or similar programs elsewhere, Pakistan has not implemented a tourist tax refund scheme, partly due to its different tax structure and administrative systems. For the best value: Focus on purchases at duty-free shops for tax-free shopping, negotiate prices at shops where bargaining is customary (though not at the airport), compare prices between airport shops and city stores before buying. If tax refunds are important for your shopping, research your specific situation before making major purchases. The information desk can clarify current policies, though substantial changes are unlikely without advance publicity.","Tax refund policy"

These services are typically operated by private vendors with clearly marked stalls or counters, usually identified by signs reading 'Baggage Wrapping' or 'Luggage Protection Service.' The service involves wrapping your entire suitcase or bag in thick, durable plastic film that protects against dirt, moisture, tampering, and minor damage during handling. This is particularly popular among Pakistani travelers and highly recommended for: bags with broken or weak handles/wheels, luggage containing fragile or valuable items, bags that look similar to many others (the wrapping makes yours distinctive), protection against unauthorized opening or theft, and keeping bags clean during transit. Prices typically range from 200-300 rupees per regular-sized bag, with larger or odd-shaped items costing 400-500 rupees. The process takes approximately 3-5 minutes per bag. The plastic wrap is transparent so security officials can still see your bag content on X-ray machines, but it provides a visible seal showing if anyone has tampered with your luggage.

When using airport exchange services, the rates are generally reasonable but may include a small premium compared to banks in the city. It's wise to compare rates between different exchange counters before completing large transactions. Always keep your exchange receipts as you may need them later, especially if you want to reconvert unused rupees back to your original currency when departing Pakistan.

However, there are important considerations for currency reconversion: Most exchange services will require you to present the original exchange receipts (from when you initially converted foreign currency to rupees) to prove the money's legal origin, particularly for larger amounts. Without these receipts, exchanges may be limited or refused. Pakistani regulations typically restrict the amount of rupees that can be reconverted, often around 25% of the original amount exchanged or up to certain maximum limits. Exchange rates for reconversion are generally less favorable than the original exchange, meaning you'll likely lose money in the double conversion process. For this reason, it's advisable to plan your spending in Pakistan carefully and exchange only what you're likely to need. Small amounts of leftover rupees (notes and coins) can be donated to charity boxes available at the airport, kept as souvenirs, or saved for a future visit to Pakistan. Alternatively, some travelers use remaining rupees for last-minute airport purchases like snacks, books, or souvenirs.

Available assistance includes: Information desks and customer service counters where staff can communicate through written notes when verbal communication is difficult, visual display boards throughout the terminal showing flight information, gate assignments, and important announcements, text-based information through the airport's mobile app and website, and special assistance that can be arranged through airlines in advance—some staff may have basic sign language training. For deaf or hard-of-hearing passengers, it's highly recommended to: Request special assistance when booking your flight, informing the airline of your needs so they can arrange appropriate support.

These stores, positioned near gate clusters and the food court, stock: various brands of bottled water in different sizes (500ml, 1 liter, 1.5 liter bottles), carbonated soft drinks and sodas, juice boxes and bottled juices, energy drinks, traditional Pakistani drinks like Rooh Afza, sports drinks, and milk beverages. While these stores don't typically sell wholesale quantities, you can purchase multiple bottles without issue—this is common for passengers stocking up for flights or long journeys. Prices are higher than in regular markets due to airport premium pricing, typically 80-150 rupees for 500ml water bottles and 150-300 rupees for larger bottles or specialty drinks. A practical tip: After passing through security, you can refill empty water bottles at the water fountains and refill stations located throughout the terminal, which provide free filtered drinking water. This is both economical and environmentally friendly. If you're purchasing beverages for a group or family, consider asking staff if they offer any multi-purchase discounts, though this isn't standard practice. Remember that liquid restrictions apply only to items brought through security—once you're in the departure lounge after security screening, you can purchase and carry any quantity of liquids onto your flight. The convenience stores also sell snacks, sandwiches, and packaged food items if you want to avoid airline meal costs or have dietary restrictions.","Bulk beverages | Auto-generated"

[97]","en","facilities","departure","{""facility"":""SIM shop"",""service"":""international""}","The telecom shops at Islamabad International Airport primarily sell Pakistani SIM cards (Jazz, Telenor, Zong, Ufone) for use within Pakistan. International SIM cards for specific other countries are generally not available at the airport, as each country's telecommunications are regulated locally and sold primarily within that country. However, you have several alternatives for international connectivity: Purchase international roaming packages from the telecom shops for your Pakistani SIM card if you're a local—these work in many countries but can be expensive. Buy travel SIM cards or international SIM cards online before your trip through services like OneSimCard, WorldSIM, or Truphone that work in multiple countries. Consider eSIM services if your phone supports eSIM technology—these can be purchased and activated digitally without physical SIM cards, providing connectivity in many countries. Plan to purchase local SIM cards upon arrival at your destination airport or in the destination city, which is usually the most economical option. Many international airports have SIM card vending machines or shops in arrival halls. For short trips, international roaming from your home carrier might be sufficient despite higher costs. Some Pakistani operators offer reasonable international roaming rates for neighboring countries like UAE, Saudi Arabia, and others. The telecom shop staff can advise on international roaming options and rates if you're using a Pakistani number. If you're departing Pakistan and need connectivity during layovers or in transit, consider downloading offline maps, translators, and essential information before leaving areas with WiFi.","International connectivity | Auto-generated"

However, you may find limited selections at: Souvenir shops near Gates 4 and 7 which occasionally carry compilation CDs of Pakistani music, qawwali (Sufi devotional music), or traditional music performances. The bookshop near Gate 6 sometimes stocks cultural media alongside books. Gift shops may have audio or video compilations of Pakistani content packaged for tourists.

The souvenir shops carry other cultural items that capture Pakistani heritage: traditional handicrafts, miniature truck art, music-themed decorative items, books about Pakistani music traditions, and traditional instruments like small tablas or harmoniums if available. For serious collectors of Pakistani music, your best options are: specialty music stores in Islamabad or Rawalpindi (staff at information desks can provide directions), downloading digital content before leaving Pakistan using the airport WiFi, purchasing from online Pakistani music retailers who ship internationally, or exploring streaming platforms after you return home.

"200","What is the economy class allowance for passengers? [100]","en","facilities","departure","{""service"":""tax refund"",""financial"":""VAT""}","Pakistan currently does not have a widespread VAT refund or tax refund system for tourists similar to systems in European countries or other regions. Most purchases in Pakistan include applicable taxes in the final price, but there is no formal mechanism at the airport for tourists to reclaim these taxes when departing. However, some relevant considerations: Duty-free shopping after security clearance is available where you can purchase items without certain taxes—this is the primary tax-saving opportunity at the airport. The duty-free shops offer cosmetics, perfumes, electronics, liquor (for non-Muslim travelers departing internationally), tobacco products, and other goods at tax-free prices. For major purchases outside the airport: Some high-end retailers or hotels catering to international clients may offer tax invoices, though refund mechanisms are limited. Keep all receipts for expensive items as customs documentation may be needed in your home country. If you're making significant purchases for business purposes, consult with a Pakistani tax professional about potential tax documentation for business expense claims in your home country. Unlike the European Union's Tax Free Shopping system or similar programs elsewhere, Pakistan has not implemented a tourist tax refund scheme, partly due to its different tax structure and administrative systems. For the best value: Focus on purchases at duty-free shops for tax-free shopping, negotiate prices at shops where bargaining is customary (though not at the airport), compare prices between airport shops and city stores before buying. If tax refunds are important for your shopping, research your specific situation before making major purchases. The information desk can clarify current policies, though substantial changes are unlikely without advance publicity.","Tax refund policy | Auto-generated"
