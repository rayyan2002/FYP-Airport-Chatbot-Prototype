Temperature-sensitive items should be informed to airline staff for special handling."
56,How can I find out if the aircraft for my flight has changed?,"Aircraft changes occur for operational reasons. The best way to confirm is by checking your boarding pass after check-in; the aircraft type is often printed on it. Airlines also update aircraft details on their mobile apps. At the gate, display screens sometimes show the new aircraft code. If you notice changes in seat layout or your seat number shifts, it's a sign the aircraft has changed. Gate agents can always verify this for you."
57,What should I do if I accidentally booked the wrong flight date?,"If you booked the wrong date, immediately visit your airline’s check-in counter or ticket office at the airport. Many airlines allow same-day corrections with a re-issuance fee. If seats are available, staff may shift you to the correct flight.

Try increasing screen brightness if it's on your phone. If the issue persists, visit your airline’s check-in counter or help desk—they will reprint your boarding pass instantly. Security officers will only allow you through once the barcode is validated. It's best to keep a backup printout or screenshot to avoid delays."
60,How do I know if my flight is codeshare with another airline?,"A codeshare flight usually has two different airline numbers for the same journey.

Codeshare flights often have shared facilities, but services like seat selection may vary depending on the operating airline's rules."
61,Can I use power banks on the aircraft?,"Yes, power banks are allowed only in cabin baggage, not in checked luggage. Look for power banks with a capacity under 100Wh to avoid restrictions.

If your power bank is damaged or swollen, security will not allow it on board for safety reasons."
62,What should I do if my boarding gate closes while I'm still in the lounge?,"If the gate has closed, immediately approach the nearest airline staff or supervisor. Sometimes, if the aircraft door is still open, they may request the crew to allow you in. If not, you may need to rebook on the next available flight, often with a fee. Always stay within hearing distance of your gate, as gate changes or early closures are common. Set mobile reminders to avoid missing announcements."
63,Is photography allowed inside the departure terminal?,"General photography inside terminals is allowed, but certain areas like immigration, security, and staff offices are restricted.

64,How can I track my checked baggage after dropping it?,"After baggage drop, each bag receives a tag with a tracking number. Keep the baggage receipt attached to your boarding pass.

Always double-check that your destination is printed correctly. Reaching the airport early ensures proper tagging and safer handling."
65,Do airports allow carrying Zamzam water in checked baggage?,"Yes, most airlines allow passengers to carry properly sealed Zamzam water in checked luggage, especially for flights from Saudi Arabia.

Check weight limits, as Zamzam containers are often heavy. Security does not allow Zamzam water inside cabin baggage under any circumstances."
66,What should I do if my flight is overbooked?,"Overbooking happens when airlines sell more seats than available. If you’re affected, they may ask for volunteers to take a later flight in exchange for compensation.

Knowing your passenger rights helps you negotiate for fair compensation."
67,How do I confirm if my seat has extra legroom?,"Extra legroom seats are usually located in exit rows or front cabin rows.

Always check the latest airline policies, as rules change frequently due to safety concerns."
69,How early does the airport open for morning departures?,"Most terminals open 24/7, but check-in counters open 3 to 4 hours before flight time.

Arriving early ensures smooth baggage drop and seat confirmation. Morning flights often experience long queues, so planning ahead saves time."
70,Can I bring homemade food in my cabin bag?,"Yes, homemade food is generally allowed in cabin baggage. However, avoid carrying liquid or semi-liquid food items such as soups, sauces, and curries, as they may be restricted.

Always pack food securely to avoid spills during security checks or inside the aircraft."
71,What should I do if my boarding pass shows “Seat to be assigned at gate”?,"When your boarding pass states that your seat will be assigned at the gate, it usually means the flight is close to full capacity. Gate agents will assign seats based on availability once final check-in numbers are confirmed. Arriving early at the gate increases your chances of getting a suitable seat, especially if you’re traveling with family. Keep checking the display monitors for boarding groups. Avoid leaving the area because seat assignment announcements can happen quickly. If you have special requirements, inform the staff immediately."
72,Is it possible to request a seat change after checking in?,"Yes, seat changes are possible but depend on availability. After checking in, you can ask staff at the check-in counter or gate desk to help you switch seats. They can view real-time seat maps and suggest options.

For upgrades to extra-legroom seats, additional charges may apply. Always confirm your new seat on the final boarding pass."
73,What are the guidelines for carrying fragile items like glass souvenirs?,"Fragile items should be packed securely using bubble wrap or shock-absorbing materials. Airlines normally recommend placing them in hand-carry for safety. However, if the item is large, check-in staff may advise special handling procedures. Inform the staff so they can label your baggage as “Fragile.” Avoid placing valuable or easily breakable items in checked bags. Arrive early to ensure careful processing. Always carry receipts for expensive souvenir items, as customs officers may ask for proof."
74,How can I confirm whether my flight offers in-flight Wi-Fi?,"You can check Wi-Fi availability on your airline’s official website under your flight number. Many airlines also mention this feature in the booking confirmation. At the airport, gate agents can confirm if Wi-Fi services are active for your specific aircraft model. Look for Wi-Fi stickers near the aircraft door when boarding. Keep in mind some flights only offer limited messaging services. Charges may apply, and connection strength can vary based on route and altitude."
75,What should I do if my luggage tag gets torn before dropping my bag?,"If your luggage tag tears before baggage drop, approach the check-in counter immediately. Staff can reprint a new tag instantly. Avoid taping the tag yourself, as automated baggage scanners might fail to read it. Ensure your bag has a personal ID label inside, in case the external tag gets lost. Keep your baggage receipt safe, as it’s essential for tracking. Arriving early helps avoid rushed tagging, which reduces damage risks."
76,Can I travel with temperature-sensitive food items?,"Yes, but special care is required. Pack temperature-sensitive items like chocolates, dairy, or sweets in insulated containers.

If you follow a specific diet, request special meals at least 24 hours before departure. Even on flights without meals, crew often sell snacks onboard."
78,What are the rules for carrying large paintings on flights?,"Paintings are treated as oversized or delicate items. Airlines may allow them as cabin baggage if they fit overhead bins; otherwise, you may purchase an extra seat. Large paintings must go in checked luggage with special fragile labels. At check-in, staff will measure the dimensions to confirm eligibility. Wrap the painting properly to prevent damage. Special handling charges may apply for oversized art pieces."
79,What should I do if the airline app shows a different departure time than the airport screens?,"When there’s a difference between app and screen timings, always trust the airport’s official display boards. The app may update slower due to network delays. Approach the airline help desk to verify the accurate time. Gate agents can give real-time information from the operations system. Avoid relying solely on SMS updates during peak traffic hours. Always stay near your gate to hear announcements directly."
80,How do I know if my cabin bag is within the correct size limits?,"Most airlines display cabin bag size limits at check-in counters and security entrances. Use the metal measuring frame provided to check dimensions. Staff can also confirm whether your bag meets requirements. If your bag exceeds limits, they may ask you to check it in. Arriving early offers time to repack if needed. Always check your airline’s website before traveling to avoid surprises at the airport."

Immigration authorities may also require a clear and valid ID. Always replace damaged passports or CNICs before travel to avoid delays."

Once through security, head directly to your gate without stopping. Always arrive early to avoid such stressful situations."
84,How can I check if my flight will experience turbulence based on weather?,"While exact turbulence predictions aren't publicly available, you can monitor weather forecasts for your route. Cloudy or stormy weather may increase turbulence chances. Airline apps sometimes provide basic flight conditions. At the gate, pilots sometimes inform passengers about expected weather. Cabins are designed to handle turbulence safely, so following crew instructions is essential. Always keep your seatbelt fastened during the flight."
85,Is it possible to book priority boarding at the airport?,"Yes, many airlines offer priority boarding upgrades at the check-in counter or gate. Fees vary depending on the route and airline.

Ask staff early before boarding groups are finalized. Availability is limited, especially on full flights."
86,Can I carry duty-free liquids if I have a connecting domestic flight?,"Duty-free liquids are allowed only if sealed in official tamper-proof bags with receipts.

Inform staff early to avoid last-minute delays.
