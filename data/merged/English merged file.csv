Many restaurant and café seating areas have power outlets at tables where you can charge while dining. Information desks may occasionally have courtesy chargers available for temporary loan in emergency situations, though availability varies. For future travel, consider investing in a personal portable power bank, which has become an essential travel accessory.

Near the shopping areas, you'll find displays of truck art (the colorful decorative style seen on Pakistani trucks and buses) and traditional calligraphy. These artistic elements are integrated throughout the terminal rather than concentrated in a single museum-style space. The displays are changed periodically to feature different themes and artists. While not as extensive as dedicated museum exhibitions, these cultural presentations offer travelers, especially international visitors, an introduction to Pakistani culture and artistic traditions. Information plaques near displays provide context and background about the featured art and cultural elements.",facilities,departure,english
79,Is there a place to buy flowers or gifts for arriving passengers?,"Fresh flower bouquets are not typically sold within the departure terminal at Islamabad International Airport, as most gift shops focus on packaged goods, souvenirs, and travel items rather than perishable fresh flowers. However, you have several options for gifts suitable for arriving passengers: The souvenir shops near Gates 4 and 7 offer beautifully packaged Pakistani handicrafts, traditional items, sweets, and gift sets that make excellent welcome presents. Chocolate shops and confectionery stores sell premium chocolates and Pakistani sweets like packaged mithai that serve as thoughtful gifts. The duty-free shops carry perfumes, cosmetics, and luxury items suitable as gifts. If you specifically need fresh flowers, you may need to arrange delivery from flower shops in Islamabad or Rawalpindi city to the airport arrivals area, coordinating the timing with the expected arrival. Some passengers pre-arrange flowers through hotel concierge services or local florists who deliver to the airport arrivals terminal at specified times. Gift baskets and food items available at the convenience stores can also serve as welcome gifts.

The souvenir shops can often arrange gift wrapping services for purchased items.",facilities,departure,english
80,Can I store my luggage overnight at the airport?,"Yes, overnight luggage storage is available at the left luggage facility located near the main entrance of the departure hall at Islamabad International Airport. This service operates 24/7 and can accommodate bags for hours, overnight, or even several days. The storage facility is secure, monitored by CCTV cameras, and staffed by trained personnel who will issue you a claim ticket that you must present to retrieve your luggage. Charges are typically calculated per bag per day (or per 24-hour period), with rates approximately 300-500 rupees per standard-sized bag, and higher rates for larger items or extended storage periods?exact pricing should be confirmed at the facility.

81,Where can I find COVID-19 testing services?,"COVID-19 testing facilities at Islamabad International Airport are located in the health screening area near the main entrance and sometimes near certain international departure gates, though availability and requirements have changed significantly as pandemic restrictions have evolved. As of current guidelines, many countries have relaxed or eliminated COVID testing requirements for travelers, but services remain available for destinations that still require them or for passengers who prefer testing for personal health reasons. The testing facility can provide: PCR tests (results typically within 24-48 hours, though express services may be available for additional fees), rapid antigen tests (results within 30-60 minutes), and official health certificates required by certain countries. It's highly advisable to check your destination country's current entry requirements well before your flight, as many nations have updated their policies. Testing fees vary but generally range from 3,000-8,000 rupees depending on the test type and turnaround time requested. For international travelers requiring COVID testing, arrive at the airport well in advance of your flight (4-5 hours for international flights) to allow time for testing and results. Some airlines also partner with specific testing providers and may have designated facilities or expedited services. Contact your airline or check the airport's official website for current COVID testing locations, hours, pricing, and requirements. Always verify destination-specific entry requirements including test timing (many countries require tests within 48-72 hours of departure) and accepted test types.",facilities,departure,english
82,Is there a place for Muslims to pray Jummah (Friday prayer)?,"Yes, the prayer rooms at Islamabad International Airport (second floor, near Gate 5) accommodate Jummah (Friday) prayers. Given that Pakistan is an Islamic country and Islamabad is the capital, the airport is well-equipped to facilitate Islamic religious observances including the special Friday congregational prayer. The prayer rooms are spacious enough to accommodate larger gatherings typical of Jummah prayers. The men's prayer room is particularly sizeable and can hold 30-40 worshippers comfortably. The timing of Jummah prayer (which replaces the regular Friday Zuhr prayer) varies by season according to solar calculations but typically falls between noon and 2:30 PM. The airport prayer rooms remain open 24/7, and on Fridays, the facility may see increased attendance during Jummah time. While a formal khutbah (sermon) and congregation led by an imam may not be regularly organized by the airport, worshippers often gather informally for Jummah prayer, and sometimes a qualified person among the travelers leads the service. The prayer rooms are oriented towards the Qibla with clear direction markings. Separate prayer spaces are maintained for men and women with appropriate privacy. Adjacent ablution facilities allow worshippers to perform wudu before prayers.

83,Can I buy Pakistani rupees if I forgot to exchange money?,"Yes, you can obtain Pakistani rupees at Islamabad International Airport even if you forgot to exchange money beforehand. Currency exchange counters are located near the main entrance of the departure terminal and within the departure lounge area after security screening. These authorized forex dealers and bank counters can exchange major international currencies including US Dollars, British Pounds, Euros, UAE Dirhams, Saudi Riyals, and other commonly traded currencies into Pakistani rupees. The counters typically operate from early morning (around 6 AM) until late evening (around 11 PM), with extended hours during peak international flight times. Additionally, numerous ATMs throughout the terminal accept international debit and credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, UnionPay) and dispense Pakistani rupees?this is often the most convenient option and may offer competitive exchange rates, though your home bank may charge foreign transaction fees (typically 1-3%). When using airport exchange services, the rates are generally reasonable but may include a small premium compared to banks in the city. It's wise to compare rates between different exchange counters before completing large transactions. Always keep your exchange receipts as you may need them later, especially if you want to reconvert unused rupees back to your original currency when departing Pakistan. For your immediate needs upon arriving in Pakistan, exchanging $50-100 or equivalent is usually sufficient to cover transportation, meals, and initial expenses.",facilities,departure,english
84,Where can I find a barber or salon for a quick haircut?,"Professional barbershop and salon services are typically limited at Islamabad International Airport. Such services are not commonly found in the main departure terminal areas accessible to all passengers. However, grooming services may be available in the Premium Lounge (first floor, near Gate 6) which sometimes offers basic grooming services like shaving or beard trimming as part of their amenities?this requires lounge access through business class tickets, eligible frequent flyer status, or day pass purchase. Some airport lounges globally include barber services, though availability at Islamabad's specific lounges should be confirmed. For quick grooming needs, the restrooms throughout the terminal have adequate facilities and mirrors for basic self-grooming. The pharmacy and convenience stores sell travel-sized grooming products, disposable razors, combs, and other personal care items if you need to freshen up. If you specifically need a professional haircut or extensive grooming services, there are several options in the nearby areas of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, though this would require leaving the airport terminal (only feasible if you haven't yet checked in or passed through security). Some hotels near the airport have in-house salons that might accommodate airport passengers. For future international travel, many major international hub airports offer premium services including barber shops and spas, but these facilities are less common in Pakistan's airports currently. Consider scheduling grooming appointments before arriving at the airport for your departure.",facilities,departure,english
85,Is there a place to buy traditional Pakistani clothing?,"Traditional Pakistani clothing and fashion items are available at the clothing and fashion shops in the departure terminal, particularly in the shopping area near Gates 4-7. While the selection at airport shops is more limited than dedicated clothing bazaars in the city, you can typically find: women's dupattas and shawls (both casual and embroidered), men's shalwar kameez sets (Pakistan's traditional outfit), ladies' kurtas and tunics suitable for travel, embroidered stoles and scarves, traditional accessories like jewelry and bangles, and sometimes children's traditional outfits. The souvenir shops also carry some textile items including smaller traditional garments and accessories. For higher-end traditional clothing or more extensive selection, the duty-free and premium shops may have designer Pakistani clothing brands. Prices vary significantly based on quality, fabric, and embroidery work?simple items might start around 1,500-3,000 rupees while premium embroidered pieces can cost significantly more. The advantage of purchasing traditional clothing at the airport is the convenience and the assurance of quality, though prices are generally higher than in city markets. If you're looking for authentic, intricate traditional Pakistani fashion with extensive variety, the markets in Rawalpindi and Islamabad offer much better selection at more competitive prices. However, for last-minute purchases or gifts, the airport shops provide reasonable options. Staff can assist with sizing and offer recommendations based on your preferences and budget.",facilities,departure,english
86,Where can I exchange rupees back to my currency?,"You can reconvert unused Pakistani rupees back to major foreign currencies at the same currency exchange counters located near the main entrance and within the departure lounge at Islamabad International Airport. However, there are important considerations for currency reconversion: Most exchange services will require you to present the original exchange receipts (from when you initially converted foreign currency to rupees) to prove the money's legal origin, particularly for larger amounts. Without these receipts, exchanges may be limited or refused. Pakistani regulations typically restrict the amount of rupees that can be reconverted, often around 25% of the original amount exchanged or up to certain maximum limits. Exchange rates for reconversion are generally less favorable than the original exchange, meaning you'll likely lose money in the double conversion process. For this reason, it's advisable to plan your spending in Pakistan carefully and exchange only what you're likely to need. Small amounts of leftover rupees (notes and coins) can be donated to charity boxes available at the airport, kept as souvenirs, or saved for a future visit to Pakistan. Alternatively, some travelers use remaining rupees for last-minute airport purchases like snacks, books, or souvenirs. The currency exchange counters operate during standard hours (approximately 6 AM to 11 PM) with possible extensions during peak international flight times. Always allow extra time for currency transactions before your flight, as queues can form during busy periods.",facilities,departure,english
87,Are there charging lockers for devices and luggage?,"Standard charging lockers (secure storage units with built-in device charging) are not currently a common feature at Islamabad International Airport. However, the airport provides several alternatives for secure device charging and luggage storage: For device charging, numerous free charging stations are available throughout the terminal at gate seating areas, featuring both standard electrical outlets and USB ports where you can charge devices while supervising them. The Premium Lounge (first floor, near Gate 6) offers secure, comfortable seating areas where you can charge devices while working or resting?this requires lounge access. Many gate seating areas have outlets integrated into the seats, allowing you to charge while remaining with your device. For luggage storage, the left luggage facility near the main entrance provides secure, staffed storage for bags and luggage (fees apply, approximately 300-500 rupees per bag per day) though these are not electronic lockers. Staff-monitored storage with security cameras ensures your belongings are safe. Some airports globally have introduced smart lockers with charging capabilities, and it's possible this feature may be added to Islamabad International Airport in future upgrades. For now, the combination of free public charging points (where you can monitor your device) and secure staffed luggage storage meets most travelers' needs. Never leave devices unattended while charging at public charging stations, as theft can occur. Keep valuables secured and within sight at all times.",facilities,departure,english
88,Can I buy prescription medications at the pharmacy?,"Yes, the 24-hour pharmacy located near the main entrance of the departure hall at Islamabad International Airport stocks prescription medications, though availability depends on the specific medication and local regulations. For prescription drugs, Pakistani pharmacies typically require a valid prescription from a licensed physician. However, some common medications that require prescriptions in other countries may be available over-the-counter in Pakistan, including certain antibiotics, pain medications, and blood pressure medicines?though regulations are becoming stricter. The airport pharmacy carries: common prescription medications for chronic conditions, pain relief medications (both OTC and prescription-strength), antibiotics for common infections, diabetes medications and insulin, cardiovascular medications, respiratory medications including asthma inhalers, and common travel medications like anti-nausea pills, anti-diarrheal medications, and altitude sickness tablets. If you have a prescription from your home country, bring it to the pharmacy and discuss your needs with the pharmacist, who can often help identify equivalent Pakistani medications. For controlled substances or specialized medications, availability may be limited. The pharmacist can provide advice on proper usage, dosing, and potential interactions. Prices for medications in Pakistan are generally much lower than in Western countries. If you require specific medications during your stay in Pakistan, consider: bringing adequate supplies from home (ensure they're legal in Pakistan and you have prescriptions), visiting larger hospitals or medical centers in Islamabad which have more comprehensive pharmacies, or consulting with a local Pakistani doctor who can write a prescription for local pharmacies. Always carry a copy of your prescriptions when traveling internationally.",facilities,departure,english
89,Where can I find adapters for international electrical outlets?,"International electrical outlet adapters and travel converters are available at several locations throughout Islamabad International Airport. You can purchase these essential travel accessories at: electronics and phone accessory shops near the main entrance, convenience stores near gate clusters (which stock basic travel adapters), duty-free shops in the departure lounge (which typically carry premium universal adapters), and souvenir shops (which sometimes include adapters in travel accessory sections). Pakistan uses Type C and Type D electrical outlets with 230V voltage and 50Hz frequency. If you're traveling from countries with different electrical standards (like North America with 110V or countries using Type A/B plugs), you'll need an adapter and possibly a voltage converter depending on your devices. Most modern electronics like phone chargers, laptops, and camera batteries have built-in voltage converters (check your device's input specifications: if it says 100-240V, you only need a plug adapter, not a voltage converter). Universal travel adapters that work in multiple countries typically cost 1,500-3,000 rupees at the airport, while basic single-country adapters may cost 500-1,000 rupees. If you forgot to bring an adapter and need to charge devices urgently, the Premium Lounge and some international airlines' gates may have universal outlets or loaner adapters available. Remember to purchase your adapter before passing through security if possible, as the best selection is usually in the shops near the entrance. For frequent travelers, investing in a quality universal adapter with multiple plug types and USB charging ports is highly recommended.",facilities,departure,english

Available tea varieties typically include: traditional black tea (Pakistan's most consumed type, brands like Tapal, Lipton Pakistan, and local varieties), Kashmiri kahwa (a traditional green tea blend with spices, almonds, and saffron), green tea varieties, cardamom-flavored tea, and specialty herbal teas. Packaged teas are available in various formats including loose leaf tea, tea bags, and sometimes traditional tea masala (spice blends). Prices range from 200-500 rupees for standard packages to 1,000-2,000 rupees for premium gift sets. The tea products are packaged attractively and suitable for both personal use and as gifts. If you want to taste Pakistani tea before purchasing, visit Gloria Jean's or the food court cafés where you can order authentic Pakistani chai (tea) made with milk and spices. The taste of properly prepared Pakistani tea is distinctive and beloved throughout the country. Staff at shops can recommend specific brands and varieties based on your preferences. Traditional Pakistani tea culture emphasizes strong, milky tea often brewed with cardamom and other spices?these packaged products allow you to recreate this experience at home.",facilities,departure,english
91,Can I get assistance for visually impaired passengers?,"Yes, Islamabad International Airport provides comprehensive assistance services for visually impaired passengers. These services can be requested at: the assistance desk at the main entrance, airline check-in counters when you check in, or by contacting your airline at least 48 hours before your flight (highly recommended for smooth arrangements). The airport offers trained personnel who provide escorts from entry through check-in, security screening, to the boarding gate and onto the aircraft. Services include verbal descriptions of surroundings, physical guidance, assistance with paperwork and forms, help navigating security procedures, and ensuring safe boarding.

The airport layout includes tactile paving in key areas to assist with wayfinding. Staff are trained in disability awareness and assistance techniques. Information desks can provide verbal directions and assistance. Security screening procedures can be adapted with staff providing clear verbal explanations of each step. For visually impaired passengers traveling alone, the escort service ensures you never need to navigate unfamiliar spaces without assistance. Many airlines also have special programs for passengers with visual impairments?contact your airline about their specific services and procedures. The assistance is provided free of charge as part of the airport's commitment to accessibility.",facilities,departure,english
92,Where can I find Pakistani spices to take home?,"Pakistani spices and culinary products make excellent gifts and are available at multiple locations in the departure terminal. The souvenir shops and gift stores near Gates 4 and 7 stock attractively packaged spice collections including: garam masala (essential Pakistani spice blend), whole and ground spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, red chili powder, biryani masala blends, nihari spice mixes, karahi masala, chat masala, and specialty items like dried fenugreek leaves (methi).

Some shops also sell other Pakistani food products like basmati rice, dried fruits, traditional sweets, and specialty ingredients.

The quality of Pakistani spices is excellent, with many considered among the best globally?particularly Pakistani red chili powder, which is known for its rich color and flavor. Shop staff can recommend appropriate gift sets and explain the uses of different spices.",facilities,departure,english
93,Is there hearing assistance or sign language support?,"Islamabad International Airport is working to improve services for hearing-impaired passengers, though specialized support may be more limited than in some international airports. Available assistance includes: Information desks and customer service counters where staff can communicate through written notes when verbal communication is difficult, visual display boards throughout the terminal showing flight information, gate assignments, and important announcements, text-based information through the airport's mobile app and website, and special assistance that can be arranged through airlines in advance?some staff may have basic sign language training. For deaf or hard-of-hearing passengers, it's highly recommended to: Request special assistance when booking your flight, informing the airline of your needs so they can arrange appropriate support. Arrive at the airport early to allow extra time for communication-intensive processes like check-in and security. Carry a notepad and pen for written communication with staff. Use your smartphone for text-based communication or translation apps. Inform security and airline staff of your hearing impairment so they can adapt their communication approach. Pakistan Sign Language (PSL) interpretation services may not be consistently available at all times, but customer service desks can try to arrange assistance if needed. The visual flight information displays are comprehensive and frequently updated, providing much of the information typically announced verbally. Airlines can arrange for staff to meet you at specific locations to provide guidance. For international flights, some airlines provide specialized services for passengers with hearing impairments. The airport is gradually implementing more accessibility features in line with international standards.",facilities,departure,english
94,Can I buy bottled water and drinks in bulk?,"Yes, you can purchase bottled water and beverages in bulk or multiple quantities at the convenience stores located throughout the departure terminal at Islamabad International Airport. These stores, positioned near gate clusters and the food court, stock: various brands of bottled water in different sizes (500ml, 1 liter, 1.5 liter bottles), carbonated soft drinks and sodas, juice boxes and bottled juices, energy drinks, traditional Pakistani drinks like Rooh Afza, sports drinks, and milk beverages. While these stores don't typically sell wholesale quantities, you can purchase multiple bottles without issue?this is common for passengers stocking up for flights or long journeys. Prices are higher than in regular markets due to airport premium pricing, typically 80-150 rupees for 500ml water bottles and 150-300 rupees for larger bottles or specialty drinks. A practical tip: After passing through security, you can refill empty water bottles at the water fountains and refill stations located throughout the terminal, which provide free filtered drinking water. This is both economical and environmentally friendly. If you're purchasing beverages for a group or family, consider asking staff if they offer any multi-purchase discounts, though this isn't standard practice. Remember that liquid restrictions apply only to items brought through security?once you're in the departure lounge after security screening, you can purchase and carry any quantity of liquids onto your flight. The convenience stores also sell snacks, sandwiches, and packaged food items if you want to avoid airline meal costs or have dietary restrictions.",facilities,departure,english
95,Where can I find local Pakistani newspapers?,"Local Pakistani newspapers in both English and Urdu are available at the bookshop near Gate 6 and at convenience stores throughout the departure terminal at Islamabad International Airport. You'll find current editions of major Pakistani publications including: English-language newspapers like Dawn (Pakistan's oldest English newspaper with comprehensive national and international news), The News International, Express Tribune (Pakistan edition of International Herald Tribune), Daily Times, and The Nation.

97,Can I buy phone SIM cards for other countries?,"The telecom shops at Islamabad International Airport primarily sell Pakistani SIM cards (Jazz, Telenor, Zong, Ufone) for use within Pakistan. International SIM cards for specific other countries are generally not available at the airport, as each country's telecommunications are regulated locally and sold primarily within that country. However, you have several alternatives for international connectivity: Purchase international roaming packages from the telecom shops for your Pakistani SIM card if you're a local?these work in many countries but can be expensive. Buy travel SIM cards or international SIM cards online before your trip through services like OneSimCard, WorldSIM, or Truphone that work in multiple countries. Consider eSIM services if your phone supports eSIM technology?these can be purchased and activated digitally without physical SIM cards, providing connectivity in many countries. Plan to purchase local SIM cards upon arrival at your destination airport or in the destination city, which is usually the most economical option. Many international airports have SIM card vending machines or shops in arrival halls. For short trips, international roaming from your home carrier might be sufficient despite higher costs. Some Pakistani operators offer reasonable international roaming rates for neighboring countries like UAE, Saudi Arabia, and others. The telecom shop staff can advise on international roaming options and rates if you're using a Pakistani number. If you're departing Pakistan and need connectivity during layovers or in transit, consider downloading offline maps, translators, and essential information before leaving areas with WiFi.",facilities,departure,english
98,Where can I find English-language books about Pakistan?,"The bookshop near Gate 6 in the departure lounge typically stocks a selection of English-language books about Pakistan, though the collection may be limited compared to specialized bookstores in the city. You can usually find: Travel guides and guidebooks for Pakistan (Lonely Planet, Rough Guides if available) covering major cities and tourist destinations. Books on Pakistani history, culture, and politics written in English for international audiences. Works by prominent Pakistani English-language authors like Mohsin Hamid, Bapsi Sidhwa, Kamila Shamsie, and others. Coffee table books featuring Pakistani art, architecture, landscapes, and cultural heritage. Collections of Pakistani poetry translated into English. Books about specific regions like the Karakoram, Northern Areas, or Indus Valley. The souvenir shops near Gates 4 and 7 sometimes carry illustrated books about Pakistani culture, crafts, and traditions suitable as gifts. Prices range from 500-1,000 rupees for paperbacks to 2,000-5,000 rupees for premium hardcover or coffee table books. If you're specifically interested in learning about Pakistan's history, culture, or current affairs, ask shop staff for recommendations?they can guide you to the most informative and well-regarded titles. For travelers leaving Pakistan, these books serve as excellent keepsakes and help share Pakistani culture with friends and family abroad. If the airport selection doesn't meet your needs, major bookstores in Islamabad like Saeed Book Bank, The Book Company, and Liberty Books offer extensive collections and may deliver to hotels if you're staying in the city before your flight.",facilities,departure,english
99,Is there a place to buy Pakistani music CDs or cultural media?,"Physical media like CDs and DVDs featuring Pakistani music and cultural content have become increasingly rare at airports as digital media has replaced physical formats. However, you may find limited selections at: Souvenir shops near Gates 4 and 7 which occasionally carry compilation CDs of Pakistani music, qawwali (Sufi devotional music), or traditional music performances. The bookshop near Gate 6 sometimes stocks cultural media alongside books. Gift shops may have audio or video compilations of Pakistani content packaged for tourists. For more reliable options to take Pakistani culture home: Digital alternatives through streaming services?before your flight, you can download Pakistani music, films, and cultural content on your devices using apps like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, or Pakistani services like Patari. Consider purchasing content through online platforms that offer Pakistani dramas, films, and music. The souvenir shops carry other cultural items that capture Pakistani heritage: traditional handicrafts, miniature truck art, music-themed decorative items, books about Pakistani music traditions, and traditional instruments like small tablas or harmoniums if available. For serious collectors of Pakistani music, your best options are: specialty music stores in Islamabad or Rawalpindi (staff at information desks can provide directions), downloading digital content before leaving Pakistan using the airport WiFi, purchasing from online Pakistani music retailers who ship internationally, or exploring streaming platforms after you return home. Pakistani music encompasses diverse genres including qawwali, classical music, pop, rock, and traditional regional folk music?all of which can be explored through digital platforms even if physical media is scarce at the airport.",facilities,departure,english
100,Can I get tax refund services for my purchases?,"Pakistan currently does not have a widespread VAT refund or tax refund system for tourists similar to systems in European countries or other regions. Most purchases in Pakistan include applicable taxes in the final price, but there is no formal mechanism at the airport for tourists to reclaim these taxes when departing. However, some relevant considerations: Duty-free shopping after security clearance is available where you can purchase items without certain taxes?this is the primary tax-saving opportunity at the airport. The duty-free shops offer cosmetics, perfumes, electronics, liquor (for non-Muslim travelers departing internationally), tobacco products, and other goods at tax-free prices. For major purchases outside the airport: Some high-end retailers or hotels catering to international clients may offer tax invoices, though refund mechanisms are limited. Keep all receipts for expensive items as customs documentation may be needed in your home country. If you're making significant purchases for business purposes, consult with a Pakistani tax professional about potential tax documentation for business expense claims in your home country. Unlike the European Union's Tax Free Shopping system or similar programs elsewhere, Pakistan has not implemented a tourist tax refund scheme, partly due to its different tax structure and administrative systems. For the best value: Focus on purchases at duty-free shops for tax-free shopping, negotiate prices at shops where bargaining is customary (though not at the airport), compare prices between airport shops and city stores before buying. If tax refunds are important for your shopping, research your specific situation before making major purchases. The information desk can clarify current policies, though substantial changes are unlikely without advance publicity.",facilities,departure,english

When using airport exchange services, the rates are generally reasonable but may include a small premium compared to banks in the city. It's wise to compare rates between different exchange counters before completing large transactions.

186,What is the business class allowance for passengers? [86],"You can reconvert unused Pakistani rupees back to major foreign currencies at the same currency exchange counters located near the main entrance and within the departure lounge at Islamabad International Airport. However, there are important considerations for currency reconversion: Most exchange services will require you to present the original exchange receipts (from when you initially converted foreign currency to rupees) to prove the money's legal origin, particularly for larger amounts. Without these receipts, exchanges may be limited or refused. Pakistani regulations typically restrict the amount of rupees that can be reconverted, often around 25% of the original amount exchanged or up to certain maximum limits. Exchange rates for reconversion are generally less favorable than the original exchange, meaning you'll likely lose money in the double conversion process. For this reason, it's advisable to plan your spending in Pakistan carefully and exchange only what you're likely to need. Small amounts of leftover rupees (notes and coins) can be donated to charity boxes available at the airport, kept as souvenirs, or saved for a future visit to Pakistan. Alternatively, some travelers use remaining rupees for last-minute airport purchases like snacks, books, or souvenirs. The currency exchange counters operate during standard hours (approximately 6 AM to 11 PM) with possible extensions during peak international flight times.

The airport pharmacy carries: common prescription medications for chronic conditions, pain relief medications (both OTC and prescription-strength), antibiotics for common infections, diabetes medications and insulin, cardiovascular medications, respiratory medications including asthma inhalers, and common travel medications like anti-nausea pills, anti-diarrheal medications, and altitude sickness tablets. If you have a prescription from your home country, bring it to the pharmacy and discuss your needs with the pharmacist, who can often help identify equivalent Pakistani medications. For controlled substances or specialized medications, availability may be limited. The pharmacist can provide advice on proper usage, dosing, and potential interactions. Prices for medications in Pakistan are generally much lower than in Western countries. If you require specific medications during your stay in Pakistan, consider: bringing adequate supplies from home (ensure they're legal in Pakistan and you have prescriptions), visiting larger hospitals or medical centers in Islamabad which have more comprehensive pharmacies, or consulting with a local Pakistani doctor who can write a prescription for local pharmacies. Always carry a copy of your prescriptions when traveling internationally.",facilities,departure,english
189,Please tell me: where can i find the power in the departure hall?,"International electrical outlet adapters and travel converters are available at several locations throughout Islamabad International Airport. You can purchase these essential travel accessories at: electronics and phone accessory shops near the main entrance, convenience stores near gate clusters (which stock basic travel adapters), duty-free shops in the departure lounge (which typically carry premium universal adapters), and souvenir shops (which sometimes include adapters in travel accessory sections). Pakistan uses Type C and Type D electrical outlets with 230V voltage and 50Hz frequency. If you're traveling from countries with different electrical standards (like North America with 110V or countries using Type A/B plugs), you'll need an adapter and possibly a voltage converter depending on your devices. Most modern electronics like phone chargers, laptops, and camera batteries have built-in voltage converters (check your device's input specifications: if it says 100-240V, you only need a plug adapter, not a voltage converter). Universal travel adapters that work in multiple countries typically cost 1,500-3,000 rupees at the airport, while basic single-country adapters may cost 500-1,000 rupees. If you forgot to bring an adapter and need to charge devices urgently, the Premium Lounge and some international airlines' gates may have universal outlets or loaner adapters available. Remember to purchase your adapter before passing through security if possible, as the best selection is usually in the shops near the entrance. For frequent travelers, investing in a quality universal adapter with multiple plug types and USB charging ports is highly recommended.",facilities,departure,english

Available tea varieties typically include: traditional black tea (Pakistan's most consumed type, brands like Tapal, Lipton Pakistan, and local varieties), Kashmiri kahwa (a traditional green tea blend with spices, almonds, and saffron), green tea varieties, cardamom-flavored tea, and specialty herbal teas. Packaged teas are available in various formats including loose leaf tea, tea bags, and sometimes traditional tea masala (spice blends). Prices range from 200-500 rupees for standard packages to 1,000-2,000 rupees for premium gift sets. The tea products are packaged attractively and suitable for both personal use and as gifts. If you want to taste Pakistani tea before purchasing, visit Gloria Jean's or the food court cafés where you can order authentic Pakistani chai (tea) made with milk and spices.

The souvenir shops and gift stores near Gates 4 and 7 stock attractively packaged spice collections including: garam masala (essential Pakistani spice blend), whole and ground spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, red chili powder, biryani masala blends, nihari spice mixes, karahi masala, chat masala, and specialty items like dried fenugreek leaves (methi).

193,Are there special counters for elderly passengers at check-in?,"Islamabad International Airport is working to improve services for hearing-impaired passengers, though specialized support may be more limited than in some international airports. Available assistance includes: Information desks and customer service counters where staff can communicate through written notes when verbal communication is difficult, visual display boards throughout the terminal showing flight information, gate assignments, and important announcements, text-based information through the airport's mobile app and website, and special assistance that can be arranged through airlines in advance?some staff may have basic sign language training. For deaf or hard-of-hearing passengers, it's highly recommended to: Request special assistance when booking your flight, informing the airline of your needs so they can arrange appropriate support. Arrive at the airport early to allow extra time for communication-intensive processes like check-in and security. Carry a notepad and pen for written communication with staff. Use your smartphone for text-based communication or translation apps. Inform security and airline staff of your hearing impairment so they can adapt their communication approach. Pakistan Sign Language (PSL) interpretation services may not be consistently available at all times, but customer service desks can try to arrange assistance if needed. The visual flight information displays are comprehensive and frequently updated, providing much of the information typically announced verbally. Airlines can arrange for staff to meet you at specific locations to provide guidance. For international flights, some airlines provide specialized services for passengers with hearing impairments.

194,What is the business class allowance for passengers ? can you confirm?

While these stores don't typically sell wholesale quantities, you can purchase multiple bottles without issue?this is common for passengers stocking up for flights or long journeys. Prices are higher than in regular markets due to airport premium pricing, typically 80-150 rupees for 500ml water bottles and 150-300 rupees for larger bottles or specialty drinks. A practical tip: After passing through security, you can refill empty water bottles at the water fountains and refill stations located throughout the terminal, which provide free filtered drinking water. This is both economical and environmentally friendly. If you're purchasing beverages for a group or family, consider asking staff if they offer any multi-purchase discounts, though this isn't standard practice. Remember that liquid restrictions apply only to items brought through security?once you're in the departure lounge after security screening, you can purchase and carry any quantity of liquids onto your flight. The convenience stores also sell snacks, sandwiches, and packaged food items if you want to avoid airline meal costs or have dietary restrictions.",facilities,departure,english
195,Where can I find the left-luggage in the departure hall ? can you confirm?,"Local Pakistani newspapers in both English and Urdu are available at the bookshop near Gate 6 and at convenience stores throughout the departure terminal at Islamabad International Airport.

197,Please tell me: what are the packing recommendations for baby formula? [97],"The telecom shops at Islamabad International Airport primarily sell Pakistani SIM cards (Jazz, Telenor, Zong, Ufone) for use within Pakistan. International SIM cards for specific other countries are generally not available at the airport, as each country's telecommunications are regulated locally and sold primarily within that country. However, you have several alternatives for international connectivity: Purchase international roaming packages from the telecom shops for your Pakistani SIM card if you're a local?these work in many countries but can be expensive. Buy travel SIM cards or international SIM cards online before your trip through services like OneSimCard, WorldSIM, or Truphone that work in multiple countries. Consider eSIM services if your phone supports eSIM technology?these can be purchased and activated digitally without physical SIM cards, providing connectivity in many countries. Plan to purchase local SIM cards upon arrival at your destination airport or in the destination city, which is usually the most economical option. Many international airports have SIM card vending machines or shops in arrival halls. For short trips, international roaming from your home carrier might be sufficient despite higher costs. Some Pakistani operators offer reasonable international roaming rates for neighboring countries like UAE, Saudi Arabia, and others. The telecom shop staff can advise on international roaming options and rates if you're using a Pakistani number. If you're departing Pakistan and need connectivity during layovers or in transit, consider downloading offline maps, translators, and essential information before leaving areas with WiFi.",facilities,departure,english
198,Can I purchase extra allowance for books Pakistan online or at the airport ? can you confirm?,"The bookshop near Gate 6 in the departure lounge typically stocks a selection of English-language books about Pakistan, though the collection may be limited compared to specialized bookstores in the city.

Books on Pakistani history, culture, and politics written in English for international audiences. Works by prominent Pakistani English-language authors like Mohsin Hamid, Bapsi Sidhwa, Kamila Shamsie, and others. Coffee table books featuring Pakistani art, architecture, landscapes, and cultural heritage. Collections of Pakistani poetry translated into English. Books about specific regions like the Karakoram, Northern Areas, or Indus Valley.

Prices range from 500-1,000 rupees for paperbacks to 2,000-5,000 rupees for premium hardcover or coffee table books. If you're specifically interested in learning about Pakistan's history, culture, or current affairs, ask shop staff for recommendations?they can guide you to the most informative and well-regarded titles. For travelers leaving Pakistan, these books serve as excellent keepsakes and help share Pakistani culture with friends and family abroad. If the airport selection doesn't meet your needs, major bookstores in Islamabad like Saeed Book Bank, The Book Company, and Liberty Books offer extensive collections and may deliver to hotels if you're staying in the city before your flight.",facilities,departure,english
199,Where can I find the left-luggage in the departure hall? Please advise. [99],"Physical media like CDs and DVDs featuring Pakistani music and cultural content have become increasingly rare at airports as digital media has replaced physical formats. However, you may find limited selections at: Souvenir shops near Gates 4 and 7 which occasionally carry compilation CDs of Pakistani music, qawwali (Sufi devotional music), or traditional music performances. The bookshop near Gate 6 sometimes stocks cultural media alongside books. Gift shops may have audio or video compilations of Pakistani content packaged for tourists. For more reliable options to take Pakistani culture home: Digital alternatives through streaming services?before your flight, you can download Pakistani music, films, and cultural content on your devices using apps like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, or Pakistani services like Patari. Consider purchasing content through online platforms that offer Pakistani dramas, films, and music. The souvenir shops carry other cultural items that capture Pakistani heritage: traditional handicrafts, miniature truck art, music-themed decorative items, books about Pakistani music traditions, and traditional instruments like small tablas or harmoniums if available. For serious collectors of Pakistani music, your best options are: specialty music stores in Islamabad or Rawalpindi (staff at information desks can provide directions), downloading digital content before leaving Pakistan using the airport WiFi, purchasing from online Pakistani music retailers who ship internationally, or exploring streaming platforms after you return home. Pakistani music encompasses diverse genres including qawwali, classical music, pop, rock, and traditional regional folk music?all of which can be explored through digital platforms even if physical media is scarce at the airport.",facilities,departure,english
200,What is the economy class allowance for passengers? [100],"Pakistan currently does not have a widespread VAT refund or tax refund system for tourists similar to systems in European countries or other regions. Most purchases in Pakistan include applicable taxes in the final price, but there is no formal mechanism at the airport for tourists to reclaim these taxes when departing. However, some relevant considerations: Duty-free shopping after security clearance is available where you can purchase items without certain taxes?this is the primary tax-saving opportunity at the airport. The duty-free shops offer cosmetics, perfumes, electronics, liquor (for non-Muslim travelers departing internationally), tobacco products, and other goods at tax-free prices. For major purchases outside the airport: Some high-end retailers or hotels catering to international clients may offer tax invoices, though refund mechanisms are limited. Keep all receipts for expensive items as customs documentation may be needed in your home country. If you're making significant purchases for business purposes, consult with a Pakistani tax professional about potential tax documentation for business expense claims in your home country. Unlike the European Union's Tax Free Shopping system or similar programs elsewhere, Pakistan has not implemented a tourist tax refund scheme, partly due to its different tax structure and administrative systems. For the best value: Focus on purchases at duty-free shops for tax-free shopping, negotiate prices at shops where bargaining is customary (though not at the airport), compare prices between airport shops and city stores before buying. If tax refunds are important for your shopping, research your specific situation before making major purchases. The information desk can clarify current policies, though substantial changes are unlikely without advance publicity.",facilities,departure,english

52,What if my connecting flight is with a different airline?,"When you have connecting flights with different airlines at Islamabad International Airport, you will need to collect your checked baggage from the first flight's baggage claim area and then re-check it with your second airline at their designated check-in counter. This is standard procedure for inter-airline connections because each airline has separate baggage handling systems and liability. Before your first flight departs, confirm the complete transfer procedure with your initial airline's check-in staff, as they can provide specific guidance about timing and which counter to use for your connecting airline. Make sure to allow sufficient time between flights - we recommend at least 3-4 hours for domestic connections and 4-5 hours for international connections when switching airlines. Keep your baggage claim tags from both flights safe, and ensure your connecting flight boarding pass is ready when you re-check your bags.",baggage,departure,english
53,Can I take dried fruits and nuts in my hand luggage?,"Yes, you can absolutely carry dried fruits, nuts, seeds, and other packaged snacks in your hand luggage without any quantity restrictions or special permissions required. These items are not classified as liquids or restricted goods, so they pass through security screening without issues. For convenience and to speed up security checks, it's best to keep these food items in their original sealed packaging or place them in clear, transparent plastic bags or containers. This makes it easier for security personnel to identify the contents quickly during X-ray screening. Popular items like almonds, cashews, pistachios, dried apricots, dates, raisins, and trail mixes are commonly carried by passengers and are perfectly acceptable. However, avoid carrying items with excessive moisture or those that might leak, as these could cause inconvenience during your flight.",baggage,departure,english
54,"My flight is delayed by 5 hours, where can I store my baggage?","For significant flight delays, Islamabad International Airport offers left luggage storage facilities located near the main entrance of the departure hall, making it convenient for passengers who want to move around freely without carrying heavy bags. The storage service operates 24/7 and charges approximately PKR 300-500 per bag per day, depending on the size and weight of your luggage. This facility is secure, monitored by CCTV cameras, and staffed by trained personnel who will provide you with a claim ticket that you must present when retrieving your bags. Alternatively, you should check with your airline at their customer service desk, as many airlines offer complimentary temporary baggage storage for passengers affected by significant delays, especially if the delay is due to the airline's operational issues. When using any storage service, make sure to remove valuable items, important documents, medications, and electronic devices from your checked bags and keep them with you.",baggage,departure,english
55,Is there a machine to print baggage tags myself?,"No, Islamabad International Airport does not currently have self-service baggage tag printing kiosks available for passenger use. All baggage tags must be printed and attached by authorized airline staff at the check-in counters to ensure proper routing, weight compliance, and security protocols are followed. This system is in place because baggage tags contain specific barcodes and routing information that must be accurately entered into the airline's baggage handling system, and they must be securely attached to prevent loss or misplacement during transit. The airline staff are trained to print tags with correct destination codes, flight numbers, and handling instructions, and they verify that the tag matches your boarding pass and identification before attaching it to your luggage. After your bag is tagged, you'll receive a baggage claim receipt that you should keep safe until you collect your luggage at your destination.",baggage,departure,english

You can carry your Quran in any format - whether it's a physical book, a digital copy on your tablet or phone, or even audio recordings. Prayer beads of any material including wood, stone, or plastic are permitted without restriction. If you're carrying a prayer mat, the folding type fits easily in cabin baggage, or you can place it in checked luggage. Many Muslim passengers also carry small bottles of zamzam water, attar (fragrance), or miswak, and these are generally allowed following standard liquid restrictions for cabin baggage.",baggage,departure,english
57,"I need to carry baby milk powder for my infant, is that allowed?","Yes, baby milk formula powder, infant food, and related feeding supplies are fully permitted in cabin baggage in reasonable quantities necessary for your infant's needs during the journey. Pakistani airport security makes special accommodations for traveling parents with babies, understanding that infant nutrition is essential and time-sensitive. You can carry enough formula to last your entire trip, including extra portions for potential delays. Unlike regular powder restrictions which apply to adult passengers on some international routes, baby formula is exempt from powder quantity limits when traveling with an infant. It's helpful to keep the formula in its original branded container with labels visible, as this speeds up security screening. Along with formula powder, you're also allowed to carry pre-made liquid formula, baby food jars, breast milk, and sterilized water in quantities exceeding the normal 100ml liquid limit for cabin baggage.",baggage,departure,english
58,"My suitcase wheel is broken, will the airline accept it?","Yes, airlines at Islamabad International Airport will accept luggage with broken wheels or other external damage for check-in, as the primary concern is the contents being properly secured rather than the cosmetic condition of the bag itself. However, it's strongly recommended that you get your damaged luggage wrapped at the professional wrapping service located near the check-in counters, which costs approximately PKR 200-300 per bag. Wrapping provides several benefits: it prevents further damage during baggage handling, keeps broken parts from catching on conveyor belts, protects the bag's contents from exposure if the damage worsens, and prevents items from falling out through damaged areas. The wrapping service uses industrial-grade plastic wrap that's specifically designed for luggage protection. If your wheel is completely detached, inform the check-in staff so they can add a 'fragile' or 'handle with care' tag to your bag.",baggage,departure,english
59,Can I bring my traditional hookah in checked baggage?,"Yes, traditional hookahs (sheesha/huqqa) are permitted in checked baggage at Pakistani airports, as they are recognized cultural items that many travelers transport between cities or take as gifts abroad. However, there are important preparation requirements you must follow. The hookah must be completely clean with absolutely no tobacco residue remaining - clean all chambers, hoses, and the bowl thoroughly before packing. Tobacco, flavored molasses, or charcoal for hookah use cannot be carried in cabin baggage and have restrictions in checked baggage too, so verify specific airline policies. Pack your hookah carefully with adequate cushioning to prevent the glass base from breaking during handling - bubble wrap, foam, or thick clothing works well for padding. If the hookah has multiple parts, consider packing them separately and securing loose components so they don't move around and cause damage.",baggage,departure,english
60,Is there a special counter for families with small children?,"Yes, Islamabad International Airport has dedicated family check-in lanes specifically designed for passengers traveling with young children and infants, located at counters 15-18 in the main departure hall. These priority lanes are clearly marked with family signage and are designed to make the check-in process faster and less stressful for parents managing children and luggage simultaneously. The family lanes typically have shorter queues and the staff working these counters are trained to assist with family-specific needs such as checking strollers, car seats, and extra baby equipment. When you arrive at the airport, look for the signage indicating family lanes or ask any airport staff member to direct you to the appropriate counters. Besides check-in, the airport also has family-friendly facilities throughout the terminal including baby changing rooms, nursing rooms for mothers, children's play areas, and family restrooms.",baggage,departure,english
61,"I forgot to remove my laptop during security screening, what happens?","If you forget to remove your laptop during security screening, the security personnel will politely ask you to return and resubmit your bag for scanning with the laptop placed separately in a dedicated screening tray. This is standard security protocol at all airports including Islamabad International Airport, as laptops and other large electronic devices need individual X-ray examination to ensure they don't contain prohibited items or pose security threats. The screening process requires laptops, tablets larger than phone size, and sometimes even large power banks to be removed from bags and placed flat in separate trays so the X-ray machine can clearly image all internal components. This delay is minor but can cause queues behind you, so it's best to prepare before reaching the conveyor belt. Take out your laptop while waiting in line and have it ready in your hands or an easily accessible pocket of your carry-on. The same rule applies to cameras, portable DVD players, and gaming consoles. Remember to collect all your items after screening, including the laptop tray and your main bag.",baggage,departure,english
62,Can I carry blood pressure medicine without a prescription?,"While it's technically possible to carry common medications including blood pressure tablets without a prescription at Pakistani airports, having proper documentation is strongly recommended for several important reasons. Airport security and customs officials may ask about medications, especially if carrying large quantities or controlled substances, and a prescription serves as immediate proof that these are legitimate medical supplies for personal use. Keep medicines in their original pharmacy packaging with labels showing your name, medication name, dosage, and prescribing doctor - this is the best form of documentation. If you've lost the original packaging, carrying a doctor's letter or prescription photocopy is very helpful. For blood pressure medication specifically, which is usually not a controlled substance, you're unlikely to face issues, but documentation prevents any potential delays or questions at security or customs. The prescription is particularly important for international travel, as different countries have varying regulations about importing medications. Carry a sufficient supply for your trip plus a few extra days in case of delays, and always keep essential medications in your cabin baggage rather than checked luggage.",baggage,departure,english
63,"My bag's zipper broke, what should I do before check-in?","If your bag's zipper breaks before check-in, you have several immediate options to handle the situation at Islamabad International Airport. The best solution is to use the professional baggage wrapping service located near the check-in counters in the departure hall, which costs PKR 200-300 per bag. This industrial-strength plastic wrapping will completely secure your bag, preventing it from opening during transit and protecting your belongings even with a broken zipper. The wrapping also adds an extra layer of security against tampering and weather exposure. Alternatively, if you have a spare bag or an empty suitcase, you can transfer your contents to the intact luggage - though this might be time-consuming if you're running late. Some passengers use luggage straps or belts to secure broken zippers, which can work for minor zip issues but isn't reliable for completely non-functional zippers. Airport shops sometimes sell basic duffel bags or travel bags if you need an emergency replacement. Whatever solution you choose, don't attempt to check in a bag that's likely to open during handling, as this violates baggage safety regulations and risks losing your belongings.",baggage,departure,english
64,Where can I find a luggage trolley?,"Free luggage trolleys are readily available throughout Islamabad International Airport at multiple convenient locations to help passengers transport their baggage easily. You'll find trolley bays at the main terminal entrance where passengers first arrive, in the parking area near the drop-off zones, throughout the departure hall near check-in counters, and in the arrival area near baggage claim belts. The trolleys are designed to hold multiple bags and are free to use without requiring any deposit or coins, unlike some international airports. To locate the nearest trolley bay, look for signage or ask any airport staff member wearing a uniform or information desk personnel. After using a trolley, you're encouraged to return it to designated collection areas to keep walkways clear and ensure availability for other passengers. If you're unable to find an available trolley during peak times, airport porter services are also available for a small fee to assist with carrying luggage. The trolleys are regularly maintained and cleaned, though occasionally wheels might be stiff or squeaky - if you encounter a faulty trolley, simply exchange it for another one from the bay.",baggage,departure,english
65,Can I carry Pakistani embroidered shawls as gifts in hand luggage?,"Yes, you can absolutely carry Pakistani embroidered shawls, traditional textiles, and fabric items in your hand luggage without any restrictions. Items like pashmina shawls, silk dupattas, embroidered suits, handwoven fabrics, and other textile products are perfectly acceptable in cabin baggage and are actually ideal carry-on items because they're lightweight, don't take much space when folded, and won't be damaged by the pressure or handling that checked luggage endures. Many passengers prefer keeping valuable or delicate embroidered items in cabin baggage to prevent crushing, soiling, or potential loss that might occur in checked bags. Traditional Pakistani handicrafts including embroidered shawls from Swat, Kashmiri shawls, Multani khes, Sindhi ajrak, and Balochi needlework are commonly transported by travelers as personal items or gifts. If you're carrying multiple shawls or larger quantities of fabric, security might briefly inspect them to ensure nothing is concealed within the folds, but this is a quick visual check. For international travel, textile gifts are generally duty-free for personal use, though commercial quantities might face customs questions at your destination.",baggage,departure,english
66,What's the cabin bag weight for my Emirates flight to Dubai?,"For Emirates flights departing from Islamabad International Airport to Dubai, the standard cabin baggage allowance is 7 kilograms for Economy Class passengers, though this can vary based on your specific ticket type and frequent flyer status. Business and First Class passengers typically have higher allowances, often up to 14 kilograms across two pieces. The cabin bag dimensions must not exceed 55cm x 38cm x 20cm to fit in overhead compartments or under the seat in front of you. In addition to your main cabin bag, Emirates allows one personal item such as a laptop bag, handbag, or small backpack, which generally isn't weighed separately if it's reasonably sized. However, it's crucial to verify your specific allowance on your Emirates ticket booking or by calling Emirates customer service, as allowances can differ for special fare types, codeshare flights, or if you've purchased extra baggage options. Check-in staff at the airport will weigh cabin bags if they appear oversized, and excess weight can result in being required to check the bag with applicable fees. To be safe, pack a lightweight cabin bag and keep heavier items in checked luggage.",baggage,departure,english
67,"My bag is 2 inches bigger than the size limit, is that okay?","Airlines at Islamabad International Airport may show some flexibility for cabin baggage that's slightly oversized by an inch or two, but this is entirely at the discretion of the check-in staff and gate agents, and there's no guarantee your bag will be accepted. The official size restrictions exist because overhead compartments and under-seat spaces in aircraft have fixed dimensions, and bags exceeding these measurements genuinely cannot fit safely. If your bag is only marginally larger - especially if it's a soft-sided bag that can compress when placed in the sizing frame - you may be allowed to proceed, particularly if the flight isn't fully booked and overhead bin space is available. However, during busy flights or with strict airline policies, even slightly oversized bags will be required to be checked at the gate or counter, often incurring additional fees. Hard-shell cases have no flexibility, so if they exceed dimensions, they must be checked. To avoid last-minute stress, if you know your bag is borderline, consider checking it voluntarily at the counter rather than risking gate-checking, as voluntary check-in is often free while gate-checking might have fees.",baggage,departure,english
68,Can I pack homemade mango pickle in my checked luggage?,"Yes, you can pack homemade mango pickle (achaar) and other traditional Pakistani pickles in your checked luggage, as these are food items allowed in checked baggage both for domestic and international flights from Pakistan. Homemade pickles are a popular item for travelers to carry between cities or take abroad as gifts or personal supplies. To pack pickles safely, use plastic containers or jars rather than glass, as glass can break during baggage handling, creating a mess and potentially damaging other bags. Make sure containers are completely sealed and leak-proof - double-bag them in plastic bags as an extra precaution, because pickle oil can seep through weak seals and stain clothing and other items in your suitcase. If you must use glass jars, wrap them very carefully in bubble wrap, towels, or clothing for cushioning, and place them in the center of your bag surrounded by soft items. For international travel, check your destination country's customs regulations regarding bringing in food products, as some countries restrict agricultural imports including pickles, oils, and preserved foods. Generally, small quantities for personal consumption are acceptable, but commercial quantities may face restrictions or require declaration.",baggage,departure,english
69,"I use a wheelchair, does it count in my baggage allowance?","No, wheelchairs, mobility scooters, walkers, crutches, canes, and other mobility aids do not count toward your baggage allowance at Islamabad International Airport or on any airline operating from Pakistan. These assistive devices are transported completely free of charge regardless of size or weight, as they're classified as essential medical equipment under international aviation regulations. When you arrive at the airport, inform the check-in staff about your wheelchair so they can make appropriate arrangements - you can use your personal wheelchair throughout the terminal until reaching the aircraft door, where it will be tagged and stored in the aircraft hold. The airline will return your wheelchair to you at the aircraft door upon arrival, or you can request to have it delivered to the baggage claim area. If your wheelchair is battery-powered, special procedures apply depending on battery type - inform the airline in advance as lithium batteries require specific handling and documentation. Airlines provide manual wheelchairs free of charge if you need assistance moving through the airport. Besides wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, portable oxygen concentrators (with prior approval), and other medical devices also travel free and don't affect your baggage allowance.",baggage,departure,english
70,"My wife is inside, can I check in her baggage from here?","No, the passenger whose name is on the ticket must be physically present at the check-in counter with valid identification and boarding pass to check in baggage. This is a strict security regulation at all Pakistani airports including Islamabad International Airport, enforced to prevent unauthorized persons from checking bags and to ensure that the person responsible for the baggage contents is identified. Family members can certainly assist with carrying or pushing luggage to the counter, but the actual ticket holder must appear in person, present their ID (CNIC for domestic, passport for international), and confirm they packed their own bags when asked security questions by check-in staff. This rule exists because the passenger is legally and personally responsible for everything in their checked baggage, and staff need to verify identity and ask mandatory security questions directly to the traveler. If your wife is elsewhere in the airport, she needs to come to the check-in counter to complete the process. Airlines cannot accept baggage from anyone other than the ticketed passenger, even immediate family members, due to aviation security regulations.",baggage,departure,english
71,"I'm carrying my cricket kit, do I need any special documents?","No special documents or permits are required to carry cricket equipment as checked baggage at Islamabad International Airport - you only need your regular boarding pass and identification. Cricket bats, pads, helmets, gloves, stumps, and other cricket gear are commonly transported by passengers, especially on domestic Pakistani routes where the sport is extremely popular, and airlines are very familiar with handling such equipment. Your cricket kit will count toward your regular checked baggage weight allowance, so if your gear is heavy and you're concerned about exceeding limits, you might want to distribute items between multiple bags or be prepared to pay excess baggage fees. Cricket bats must be in checked luggage and cannot be carried in cabin baggage due to their potential use as a weapon - security will stop you if you attempt to bring them through the security checkpoint in hand luggage. For international travel, cricket equipment typically doesn't face import restrictions at most destinations, though it's wise to check if you're traveling to countries unfamiliar with the sport. If you're carrying valuable signed bats or specialized equipment, consider getting additional insurance coverage as airline liability for checked baggage is limited.",baggage,departure,english
72,Can I check in my mother's sewing machine as baggage?,"Yes, you can check in a sewing machine as baggage at Islamabad International Airport, as household items and appliances are generally permitted in checked luggage provided they're properly packed and fall within size and weight restrictions. Sewing machines, whether traditional foot-pedal models or modern electric ones, are common items transported by passengers moving between cities, sending to relatives, or taking abroad. Before packing, remove the power cord if it's an electric model and pack it separately or wrap it securely around the machine, ensuring no loose parts can move around during transit. Remove or secure the needle, as loose needles can cause injury to baggage handlers. Pack the machine in its original box if available, or use a sturdy cardboard box or hard-shell suitcase with plenty of cushioning material like bubble wrap, foam, or thick clothing to prevent damage from impact during handling. The machine will count toward your checked baggage weight allowance - sewing machines can be heavy, so verify your weight limit and be prepared for excess fees if you exceed it. If the sewing machine is particularly valuable or antique, take photos before packing as documentation for insurance purposes, though airline liability for checked items is limited.",baggage,departure,english
73,"My flight boards in 40 minutes, can I still check baggage?","You are cutting it extremely close to the baggage check-in deadline, and whether you can check baggage depends on your flight type and airline. For domestic flights within Pakistan, baggage check-in typically closes 45 minutes before departure, while international flights close 60 minutes before departure. With only 40 minutes until boarding time, you're likely past the deadline for international flights and right at the limit for domestic flights. Rush immediately to the check-in counter and explain your situation - some airlines may make exceptions if the queue isn't long and your documentation is ready, but they're not obligated to accept late baggage as it risks missing the flight's baggage loading deadline. If check-in has officially closed, you'll be offered the option to fly with cabin baggage only if your bags meet size limits, or you may need to rebook on a later flight. To avoid this situation, airports recommend arriving 3 hours early for international flights and 2 hours for domestic flights. The check-in deadline exists because checked bags must go through security screening, be transported to the aircraft, loaded in the cargo hold, and all documentation processed - this sequence requires time that can't be compressed.",baggage,departure,english
74,"I want to take honey back to my village, any restrictions?","Honey is classified as a liquid substance for aviation security purposes, so it must follow liquid restrictions depending on whether you're carrying it in checked or cabin baggage. For checked luggage, you can pack honey in any quantity without restrictions - it's perfectly acceptable to carry multiple jars or bottles in your checked bag. However, make sure containers are tightly sealed and leak-proof, and wrap them in plastic bags as a precaution, because honey can make a very sticky mess if containers crack or leak during handling. For cabin baggage, honey follows the 100ml liquid rule - you can only carry containers of 100ml or less, and they must be placed in a clear, resealable plastic bag along with other liquids like shampoo and lotion, with the total not exceeding 1 liter. Most passengers prefer to pack honey in checked baggage to avoid these restrictions and because honey bottles are often larger than 100ml. If you're traveling domestically within Pakistan, these rules apply but enforcement may be more relaxed. For international travel, be aware that some countries have agricultural import restrictions on honey due to disease concerns, so check your destination's customs regulations.",baggage,departure,english
75,Can my telescope go in the overhead bin?,"Whether your telescope can go in the overhead bin as cabin baggage depends primarily on its size - it must fit within the standard cabin baggage dimensions of approximately 56cm x 45cm x 25cm (these exact measurements vary slightly by airline). Small portable telescopes, particularly refracting telescopes in compact carrying cases, often meet these requirements and can be carried in the cabin, which is actually preferable for expensive or delicate optical equipment. However, larger reflecting telescopes, dobsonian mounted scopes, or telescopes with extended tube lengths will exceed cabin size limits and must be checked as cargo. If your telescope is cabin-size but valuable, carry it on board to prevent potential damage from checked baggage handling - optical instruments are fragile and can be misaligned by impacts. Consider using a well-padded carrying case designed for telescopes, preferably a hard case for maximum protection. If you must check a larger telescope, pack it extremely carefully with foam padding, mark it as fragile, and consider purchasing additional insurance as airline liability for damaged items is limited. Remove or secure any loose parts like eyepieces, finder scopes, and mounting hardware separately.",baggage,departure,english
76,"My bag weighs exactly 23 kilos, will they still accept it?","Yes, if your bag weighs exactly 23 kilograms, it will be accepted without any excess baggage charges, as 23kg is the standard checked baggage weight limit for economy class on most airlines. The weighing scales at check-in counters are calibrated and accurate, and you're fortunate to be precisely at the limit. However, be aware that even exceeding the limit by 0.5kg or 1kg can result in excess baggage fees, which vary by airline but typically start around PKR 500-800 per kilogram for domestic flights and USD 15-30 per kilogram for international flights. If during weighing your bag shows 23.2kg or similar minimal excess, you might politely request the check-in agent's discretion, though they're not obligated to waive charges. To avoid excess fees if you're borderline, wear your heaviest items like boots or jacket rather than packing them, or shift some items to your cabin baggage if there's space available within its 7kg limit. Each airline's policy differs - some strictly enforce weight limits while others show flexibility for minor overages, particularly for premium class passengers or frequent flyers. Always pack with a margin below the limit to account for scale variations.",baggage,departure,english
77,Can I bring Karachi's famous sohan halwa for my relatives?,"Yes, you can absolutely bring traditional Pakistani sweets like Karachi's famous sohan halwa, Multani sohan halwa, Hafiz's sweets, or any other local mithai in both your checked baggage and cabin baggage. Traditional sweets are among the most commonly transported items by Pakistani travelers visiting family or friends in other cities or abroad, and airports are very familiar with passengers carrying these food gifts. Sohan halwa and similar dry sweets are not considered liquids, so they don't face the liquid restrictions that apply to items like syrup-based sweets. For checked baggage, pack sweets in their original boxes or secure containers to prevent crushing - place them between clothing or in rigid boxes for protection. For cabin baggage, sweets are allowed but keep them accessible as security might want to visually inspect the packaging to confirm contents. The main concern is packaging - avoid anything that could leak or become messy, and if carrying items with syrup or moisture, seal them in plastic bags. For international travel, packaged commercial sweets from recognized sweet shops are generally preferred over homemade items, as they appear more legitimate to customs officials. Most countries allow small quantities of packaged sweets for personal consumption without issues.",baggage,departure,english
78,"My PIA flight was canceled yesterday, can I reuse the baggage tags?","No, you cannot reuse baggage tags from a canceled flight - all baggage tags become invalid when a flight is canceled or rescheduled, and you must obtain new tags for your rebooked flight. Each baggage tag contains specific barcoded information tied to a particular flight number, date, destination routing, and departure time, all of which have changed with your new flight. When you arrive at the airport for your rescheduled flight, proceed to the PIA check-in counter with your baggage, new booking confirmation, and identification. The check-in staff will issue fresh baggage tags with updated flight information and routing codes. Keep your old canceled flight documentation including the old baggage tag receipts in case of any disputes about rebooking or refunds, but these old tags are now just records, not valid for travel. The retagging process is quick - the staff will print new tags, attach them to your luggage, and give you new baggage claim receipts that you must safeguard until you collect your bags at your destination. This retagging requirement exists to prevent bags from being loaded onto wrong flights or misrouted through the baggage handling system.",baggage,departure,english
79,Where can I buy bubble wrap to protect my items?,"Unfortunately, Islamabad International Airport doesn't sell packing materials like bubble wrap, foam, or padding supplies in the terminal area. However, you have several alternatives to protect fragile items. The most convenient option is the professional baggage wrapping service located near the check-in counters in the departure hall, which charges PKR 200-300 per bag to wrap your entire suitcase in industrial-strength plastic wrap - while this doesn't provide internal padding, it does secure and protect the exterior. For internal cushioning, if you have time before arriving at the airport, purchase bubble wrap, foam sheets, or packing paper from stationery shops, hardware stores, or packaging material suppliers in Rawalpindi or Islamabad city. Common shops like Pace, Metro, or local markets in Saddar have these supplies. As an improvised solution at the airport, you can purchase clothing items from airport shops and use them as padding around fragile items - thick socks, sweaters, or towels work reasonably well. Some travelers use newspapers, though these aren't available for purchase at the airport. The airport's duty-free shops and retail stores focus on travel essentials, gifts, and food rather than packing supplies.",baggage,departure,english
80,Can I keep my electric shaver in my cabin bag?,"Yes, electric shavers, beard trimmers, and other battery-operated or rechargeable grooming devices are completely allowed in cabin baggage at Islamabad International Airport without any restrictions. These personal care electronic items are not classified as dangerous or prohibited goods. Keep your shaver easily accessible in your cabin bag because when you reach the security screening point, you may be asked to remove larger electronics for separate X-ray screening, though small grooming devices typically don't require removal. Both corded electric shavers and battery-operated models are permitted - if your shaver has a lithium battery, it's actually required to be in cabin baggage rather than checked luggage, as loose lithium batteries are restricted in checked bags due to fire risk. If your shaver has replaceable batteries, make sure the battery compartment is properly secured so batteries don't fall out during your journey. Other grooming tools like hair dryers, electric toothbrushes, and hair clippers are similarly allowed in cabin baggage. For liquid grooming products like shaving cream or aftershave, remember these must follow the 100ml liquid restriction and be in a clear plastic bag if carried in cabin baggage.",baggage,departure,english
81,"I work for PIA, what's my staff baggage allowance?","As a PIA employee traveling on staff tickets or ID travel, your baggage allowance differs from regular passenger allowances and depends on several factors including your employment category, rank, route, and travel class. Generally, PIA staff have more generous allowances than regular passengers, but the exact weight and piece limits vary. For accurate information specific to your situation, you should check with the PIA employee services department, consult your company travel policy handbook, or contact the ID travel desk before your trip. When checking in for your staff travel, present your PIA employee ID card along with your staff ticket to the check-in counter, and they will apply the appropriate staff baggage allowance to your booking. The allowance typically varies between domestic and international sectors, with international flights often having higher limits. Some staff positions and seniority levels may have additional privileges. If you're traveling on a positive space confirmed ticket as opposed to standby, your allowances might differ. Never assume your allowance without verification, as showing up with excess baggage expecting automatic waiver can cause issues and potential charges.",baggage,departure,english
82,"I'm taking gold jewelry for my sister's wedding, any restrictions?","You can transport gold jewelry and other valuable ornaments for personal or family use such as wedding gifts, but there are important security and customs considerations to keep in mind. For maximum security, always carry expensive jewelry in your cabin baggage rather than checked luggage - this keeps valuable items with you at all times and reduces theft risk. Checked baggage occasionally gets lost, delayed, or tampered with, and airline liability for valuable items in checked bags is very limited. While there's no restriction on the quantity of gold jewelry you can carry domestically within Pakistan, large quantities or high values should be documented with purchase receipts or family ownership records in case questions arise. For international travel, customs regulations become important - if you're carrying jewelry worth more than the duty-free allowance of your destination country, you may need to declare it and potentially pay import duty. Some countries have specific forms for temporarily importing jewelry that you'll take back with you. At Pakistani airports, security may ask to inspect jewelry during X-ray screening to verify it's genuine jewelry and not concealing prohibited items. Keep jewelry in original boxes or soft pouches to prevent damage and tangling.",baggage,departure,english
83,"My bag smells like biryani from the food I packed, is that a problem?","A mild food odor from sealed food items like biryani in your checked baggage is generally acceptable and won't prevent your bag from being checked in, as many Pakistani travelers transport home-cooked food between cities or to relatives abroad. However, there are practical considerations to keep in mind. Strong, pungent smells that might permeate throughout the baggage hold and affect other passengers' luggage should be avoided out of courtesy. The main concern isn't the smell itself but rather whether the food is properly sealed and won't leak or spill during transit - biryani with gravy can be messy if containers aren't absolutely leakproof. Use rigid, sealed plastic containers rather than thin plastic bags or aluminum foil, and double-wrap them in plastic bags as a precaution. Place food containers in the center of your bag surrounded by clothing to absorb any potential leaks and minimize odor transfer. For cabin baggage, avoid bringing strong-smelling foods as the confined aircraft cabin space makes odors more noticeable and can disturb other passengers. Security personnel might inspect food items to ensure they're indeed food and not concealing prohibited materials. If the smell is extremely strong, check-in staff might suggest additional packaging or plastic wrap to contain the odor.",baggage,departure,english
84,Can I take my tabla in the cabin instead of checking it?,"Yes, you can carry your tabla (traditional drum) as cabin baggage if it fits within the standard cabin baggage size dimensions of approximately 56cm x 45cm x 25cm and doesn't exceed the 7kg weight limit. Tablas, being relatively compact musical instruments, often fit these requirements especially if carried in a properly fitted soft case or bag. Musical instruments are valuable and can be damaged by rough handling in checked baggage, so carrying them in the cabin is actually the preferred option for many musicians. When you arrive at the check-in counter, inform the staff that you're carrying a musical instrument in cabin baggage - they may measure it to confirm it meets size requirements. Once on board, you can place the tabla in the overhead bin or under the seat in front of you, just like regular cabin baggage. If your tabla set is larger than cabin allowance or you have both tabla and other items exceeding combined limits, you'll need to check it. In that case, pack it very carefully with substantial padding, use a hard case if possible, mark it as fragile, and request delicate handling labels from check-in staff. Some airlines allow purchasing an extra seat for musical instruments that are too large for cabin but too valuable to check - inquire if this option interests you.",baggage,departure,english
85,"I bought perfume at duty-free, does it count as hand luggage?","No, items purchased at airport duty-free shops after passing through security, including perfumes, alcohol, cosmetics, and other products, do not count toward your regular cabin baggage allowance. These duty-free purchases come in special sealed tamper-evident bags with the receipt visible inside, and you can carry these additionally along with your standard cabin baggage and personal item. This exception exists because you purchased these items after security screening in the sterile area of the airport, so they've already cleared security protocols. The duty-free bags can contain liquids exceeding the normal 100ml limit that would otherwise be prohibited in cabin baggage if brought from outside the airport. You can carry multiple duty-free shopping bags without worry. However, if you have a connecting flight, especially an international connection through another country, be aware that you might need to go through security again, and those destination airports might not accept your duty-free liquids if you're transferring. For final destination flights, keep your duty-free purchases in their original sealed bags with receipt visible until you reach your destination. Don't open or tamper with the sealed bags during the flight, as this could cause issues with customs or connecting security screenings.",baggage,departure,english
86,"My flight is at 5 AM, can I check baggage the night before?","No, Islamabad International Airport does not offer night-before or overnight baggage check-in services. All baggage must be checked in on the same day as your flight departure, regardless of how early the flight is scheduled. For your 5 AM flight, check-in counters typically open 3 hours before departure for international flights and 2 hours before for domestic flights, which means counters open around 2 AM for your international flight or 3 AM for domestic. Yes, this requires arriving at the airport very early in the morning, but this is standard procedure for early morning flights worldwide. The requirement for same-day check-in exists because checked baggage must be continuously monitored for security, and airports cannot store bags overnight due to security protocols and liability concerns. Plan your transportation accordingly - you may need to arrange a taxi, use ride-sharing apps, or have family drive you to reach the airport by 2-3 AM. Some hotels near the airport offer early morning airport shuttle services. If you're traveling from far away, consider staying at an airport hotel the night before your early flight. Once you check in, you can rest in the departure lounge until your flight boards, as the terminal is open 24 hours.",baggage,departure,english
87,"My 5-year-old has a small school bag, does it count separately?","Children who are 2 years old or above traveling on a purchased ticket (not as an infant on lap) are entitled to their own baggage allowance according to the ticket class they're traveling in, just like adult passengers. So your 5-year-old has their own separate checked baggage allowance (typically 20-23kg for economy class) and cabin baggage allowance (typically 7kg). Their small school bag would count as their personal item or cabin baggage within their allowance. In practice, airlines at Islamabad International Airport are generally flexible about small children's personal items - a small school backpack worn by a 5-year-old is unlikely to be weighed separately or strictly enforced, especially if it just contains toys, snacks, and entertainment for the flight. However, technically, if you're already at your cabin baggage limit with your own bags, the child's school bag is their cabin baggage and should be within the 7kg limit. Many families strategically pack heavier items in children's checked baggage since kids rarely pack 20kg of belongings, leaving capacity to split family items across multiple baggage allowances. If the school bag is truly tiny - just containing a toy and snacks - most airlines won't count it strictly. But if it's a full-size backpack, it counts as cabin baggage under the child's allowance.",baggage,departure,english
88,"I'm diabetic, can I carry insulin injections in hand luggage?","Yes, passengers with diabetes can carry insulin, syringes, insulin pens, blood glucose monitors, test strips, lancets, and all other diabetic supplies in cabin baggage without quantity restrictions at Islamabad International Airport and all Pakistani airports. These are classified as essential medical supplies, and airports make accommodations for passengers who need medications during travel. Insulin actually should be carried in cabin baggage rather than checked luggage because the cargo hold's temperature fluctuations can potentially damage insulin's effectiveness. Carry your diabetic supplies in a clear case or bag for easy identification during security screening. While a prescription or doctor's letter is not legally required for insulin in Pakistan, having this documentation is highly recommended as it quickly verifies your medical need if questioned by security or customs officers. A doctor's letter should state your diagnosis, the prescribed insulin type and dosage, and that you require these supplies for medical purposes. Keep insulin in its original pharmacy packaging with labels showing your name and medication details. For international travel, carry enough insulin for your entire trip plus extra days' supply in case of delays, and research your destination's regulations about importing medications. Some countries require declaring medical supplies at customs.",baggage,departure,english
89,How much can I declare for valuable items in my baggage?,"The standard liability limit that airlines have for checked baggage under international aviation rules (Montreal Convention) is approximately 1,131 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), which equals roughly USD 1,500-1,700, or about PKR 400,000-450,000 at current exchange rates. This represents the maximum compensation you can receive if your checked baggage is lost, damaged, or delayed, regardless of the actual value of contents. Importantly, this limit applies per passenger, not per bag, and it's a maximum - compensation is based on actual documented losses up to this limit. The liability for domestic flights within Pakistan may be lower and is governed by Pakistan's domestic aviation regulations. If you're carrying items worth more than this liability limit - such as expensive jewelry, electronics, cameras, antiques, or other valuables - the airline is not responsible for the excess value unless you purchase additional insurance. You have several options: purchase excess valuation insurance directly from the airline at check-in (expensive but possible), buy travel insurance from independent providers that covers baggage loss up to higher amounts, or simply don't check valuable items and carry them in cabin baggage where you maintain physical control. High-value items should really travel in cabin baggage whenever possible rather than checked luggage.",baggage,departure,english
90,Can I pack document photocopies in checked luggage?,"Yes, you can pack photocopies of documents in checked luggage, and in fact it's a good practice to keep backup copies of important documents separate from originals in case of loss or theft. However, never pack original important documents in checked baggage - always keep originals of your passport, national ID card, flight tickets, boarding passes, travel insurance documents, hotel reservations, medical prescriptions, credit cards, and any other critical papers in your cabin baggage where you have direct control and access. Checked bags occasionally get lost, delayed, or stolen, and if your original documents are inside, you'll face serious problems at your destination. The photocopies in checked luggage serve as backups - if something happens to your cabin bag or you lose documents during travel, you have copies that can help with police reports, embassy assistance for replacing passports, or proving identity. Consider also keeping digital scans of all important documents in your email or cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox) accessible from your phone - this provides another backup layer. Organize documents in a waterproof document holder or ziplock bag to protect them from potential moisture or spills in your luggage. Some travelers also leave copies of important documents with family members at home who can scan and email them if needed urgently.",baggage,departure,english
91,"My hiking backpack has a metal frame, will security stop me?","Your hiking backpack with a metal frame will pass through security screening at Islamabad International Airport without issues, as metal frames in backpacks are common and not prohibited items. The X-ray machines and metal detectors are sophisticated enough to distinguish between structural metal components like frames and prohibited items like weapons. However, you should expect the screening process to take slightly longer because the metal frame will show up prominently on the X-ray screen, and security officers will want to ensure it's just a backpack frame and not concealing anything suspicious. When you place your backpack on the conveyor belt for X-ray screening, remove it from any protective covers, open all compartments and pockets, and remove any large items like laptops or tablets that need separate screening. The backpack itself can remain assembled with the frame inside. Security personnel may ask you to open the backpack for manual inspection, especially if it's heavily packed and the X-ray image isn't completely clear. Be cooperative and patient - this is routine procedure for bags with metal components. If you have trekking poles, tent stakes, or other hiking equipment with metal parts, these might require additional inspection. Carabiners, camping equipment, and similar metal outdoor gear are allowed in checked baggage but must be in checked luggage, not cabin baggage.",baggage,departure,english
92,Can I bring clay pottery from Multan in checked baggage?,"Yes, you can transport clay pottery, ceramic items, and traditional Multani blue pottery in checked baggage, but extreme care must be taken with packing because these items are very fragile and easily broken during baggage handling. Pakistani handicrafts like Multani pottery, tile work, and ceramic pieces are commonly transported by travelers as gifts or personal items. Each pottery piece should be individually wrapped in multiple layers of bubble wrap, foam, or thick paper. If you don't have professional packing materials, use clothing, towels, or blankets to wrap each item separately. Place wrapped items in the center of your suitcase surrounded by soft items like clothes, never near the edges or corners where impacts are most severe. Fill all empty spaces in the bag with soft materials to prevent items from shifting during transit. Hard-shell suitcases provide better protection than soft bags for fragile items. If transporting multiple pottery pieces, pack them so they don't touch each other directly. Consider buying luggage wrapping service at the airport (PKR 200-300) for extra protection. Critically important: understand that airlines explicitly state they are not liable for damage to fragile items in checked baggage - you pack and check such items at your own risk. If pottery items are very valuable or irreplaceable, consider shipping them separately through a specialized courier service that insures fragile items.",baggage,departure,english
93,"It rained and my bag got wet on the way, will they accept it?","Yes, slightly wet baggage from rain is acceptable for check-in at Islamabad International Airport, as airport staff understand that weather conditions sometimes cause luggage to get damp during transport to the airport. However, it's in your best interest to address the moisture before checking in. If the exterior is just damp, wipe it down with a towel or cloth available at the airport or from your car. If it's very wet, consider using the baggage wrapping service near check-in counters (PKR 200-300), which will seal the wet exterior and prevent moisture from affecting other passengers' bags in the cargo hold or dripping on airport floors. The most critical concern is protecting the contents inside your bag - immediately check that water hasn't seeped into the interior, especially around zippers and seams. Electronics, documents, and clothing inside must stay dry. If water has penetrated inside, try to dry the contents or transfer items to a plastic bag or dry bag to prevent further water damage during the flight. Water damage to baggage contents is typically not covered by airline liability if the exterior moisture was pre-existing and not caused by airline handling. For future trips during monsoon season, consider using waterproof luggage covers, rain bags, or wrapping your luggage in plastic before leaving home. Most modern suitcases have some water resistance, but prolonged rain exposure can lead to seepage.",baggage,departure,english
94,"I want to take my cricket bat and stumps to Lahore, is that allowed?","Yes, cricket equipment including bats, stumps, pads, helmets, gloves, and protective gear can be transported in checked baggage on flights from Islamabad to Lahore or any other domestic route, and this is very common given Pakistan's passion for cricket. Your cricket equipment will count toward your regular checked baggage weight allowance (typically 20-23kg for economy class), so if you have a full cricket kit bag with bat, pads, helmet, gloves, and stumps, it can be quite heavy - ensure you're within your limit or be prepared to pay excess baggage charges. Cricket bats are considered potential weapons and cannot be carried in cabin baggage under any circumstances - they must be checked in. Pack your bat carefully with padding around it to prevent the blade from being damaged, and ensure it's secured so it doesn't shift and damage other items or the bag itself. Modern English willow bats are expensive and can crack if dropped, so consider a hard case if the bat is valuable. Stumps with sharp ends should be wrapped or covered so they don't tear through the bag or injure baggage handlers. For international flights, cricket equipment is generally not restricted, though very large items like practice nets or bowling machines might require special cargo arrangements. If you're a serious player traveling for tournaments, many team managers check full kit bags as group baggage.",baggage,departure,english
95,Can I leave my bags here if I'm coming back through ISB in 3 days?,"No, Islamabad International Airport does not offer multi-day or long-term baggage storage facilities for passengers who are traveling onward and returning later. The left luggage service available at the airport is designed only for same-day or overnight storage during flight delays, layovers, or short visits, not for storage spanning multiple days between separate trips. For storing luggage for 3 days or longer, you'll need to use commercial storage facilities in Rawalpindi or Islamabad city. Some options include self-storage companies that offer secure locker services, certain hotels that provide luggage storage for guests (even after checkout, for a fee), or private luggage storage businesses near popular tourist areas. If you're staying at a hotel before your departure or after your return, ask if they can store your bags for a few days - many hotels offer this service to their guests for a minimal fee or sometimes free. The reason airports don't provide extended storage is due to security protocols - bags cannot be left unattended for multiple days due to security concerns, and airports lack the infrastructure to manage long-term storage with proper tracking and liability. For future planning, if you need to leave items between trips, arrange advance booking with a city storage facility, which is more secure and reliable than airport options anyway.",baggage,departure,english
96,"I'm taking an electric iron to my hostel, can I check it?","Yes, electric irons and other household electrical appliances are completely allowed in checked baggage at Islamabad International Airport. Students and professionals frequently transport small appliances like irons, kettles, immersion heaters, and fans when moving to hostels, universities, or new accommodation. Before packing your electric iron in checked luggage, ensure it has completely cooled down if it was recently used - hot appliances can damage other items in your bag or pose a safety risk. Empty any water from steam iron reservoirs, as water can leak during baggage handling and damage clothing or electronics in your bag. If the iron has a detachable power cord, pack it separately or wrap it securely around the iron to prevent tangling with other items. Remove any batteries if your iron has battery backup, as loose lithium batteries are restricted in checked baggage - though corded irons typically don't have batteries. Pack the iron in the center of your suitcase surrounded by clothing or soft items for cushioning, as irons can be heavy and might damage other items if they shift during transit. The iron will count toward your checked baggage weight allowance, and irons can be several kilograms, so account for this weight. For international travel, verify your destination's voltage standards - Pakistan uses 220V, and your iron should be compatible with your destination's electrical system.",baggage,departure,english
97,"My company bag has logo stickers all over, is that acceptable?","Yes, luggage with company logos, brand stickers, and decorative labels is completely acceptable and actually quite common at Islamabad International Airport. Many passengers use stickers to personalize their bags, making them easily identifiable on the baggage carousel and reducing the chance of another passenger accidentally taking your bag since many suitcases look similar. Company-branded bags from corporations, promotional bags from events, or luggage covered in travel stickers are all standard sights at airports. The only restriction would be if stickers or logos contain offensive content, hate symbols, or inappropriate imagery - these would violate airport conduct standards and might prompt staff to ask you to remove or cover them. Otherwise, corporate logos, sports team emblems, university badges, travel destination stickers, and brand names are all fine. In fact, travel experts recommend making your bag distinctive through stickers, colored ribbons, or unique tags because it speeds up identification at baggage claim and deters theft since a highly recognizable bag is harder to steal unnoticed. If your company bag is particularly distinctive with unique colors or design, you're less likely to experience the common problem of bag mix-ups where passengers accidentally take similar-looking bags. Just ensure stickers are firmly attached and won't peel off and potentially jam baggage handling equipment.",baggage,departure,english
98,Can I pack climbing rope and carabiners in my checked bag?,"Yes, mountain climbing and rock climbing equipment including ropes, carabiners, harnesses, belay devices, ascenders, descenders, and climbing shoes are all permitted in checked baggage at Pakistani airports. Pakistan has a strong mountaineering community with many climbers heading to northern areas like Gilgit-Baltistan, Hunza, and K2 base camp, so climbing gear is commonly transported. Your equipment counts toward your regular checked baggage weight allowance, and climbing gear can be quite heavy especially with ropes, so watch your weight limits to avoid excess charges. Pack metal equipment like carabiners carefully so they don't damage the bag interior or other contents - consider a dedicated climbing gear bag or duffel. Coil ropes neatly and secure them to prevent tangling and make the bag easier to handle. Climbing harnesses and soft gear can go anywhere in the bag. Remove any sharp items like ice axes, crampons, or pitons from checked bags and pack them very carefully wrapped and secured, as truly sharp items may require additional security clearance. For international mountaineering expeditions, your equipment faces no restrictions, though commercial quantities of gear might raise questions. If you're part of a climbing expedition, coordinate with your team about distributing group equipment across multiple bags to avoid overweight issues. Consider gear insurance as airline liability for sports equipment is limited.",baggage,departure,english
99,"I'm connecting from Islamabad to Peshawar, will my bag go directly?","For connecting domestic flights within Pakistan on the same airline, your checked baggage is typically checked through directly to your final destination (Peshawar), meaning you won't need to collect it at Islamabad and re-check it. When you check in at your origin city, inform the check-in agent that you have a connecting flight and provide both flight details - they will tag your bag with routing labels to Peshawar via Islamabad. You'll receive baggage claim tags and the staff should confirm that your bag is checked through to your final destination. However, it's essential to confirm this explicitly at check-in, as not all domestic connections are set up for through-checked baggage, especially if flights are on different airlines or have long layovers. If your connection is with a different airline, you'll likely need to collect baggage in Islamabad and re-check it with the second airline. For same-airline connections, ensure your layover time is sufficient (at least 2-3 hours recommended) in case your first flight is delayed and you need to catch up with your connecting flight. If your first flight is significantly delayed and you miss your connection, the airline will rebook you and your bag will be rerouted to your next available flight - your baggage tags allow tracking throughout this process.",baggage,departure,english
100,Can I carry green tea and herbal chai in my hand luggage?,"Yes, you can carry green tea, herbal chai, black tea, traditional Kashmiri kahwa, and other tea products in your hand luggage without any restrictions at Islamabad International Airport. Tea in its dry form - whether loose tea leaves, tea bags, tea powder, or dried herbs - is not classified as a liquid or restricted substance, so standard baggage rules apply. These items pass through security screening easily and are commonly carried by Pakistani travelers who want their preferred tea brands or traditional varieties that might not be available at their destination. Keep tea in its original packaging when possible, as branded packaging makes identification quick during security screening. If you're carrying loose tea or have transferred it to containers, use clear or transparent packaging so security personnel can visually inspect the contents if needed. Popular items like green tea bags, Tapal Danedar, Lipton tea bags, herbal infusions, and medicinal teas like senna or chamomile are all acceptable. The quantity you can carry is not specifically restricted as long as it fits within your cabin baggage weight limit (typically 7kg). For international travel, be aware that some countries have agricultural restrictions on plant materials including tea, though commercial packaged tea from recognized brands rarely faces issues. Traditional Pakistani chai with mixed spices is also allowed as long as the spices are pre-packaged.",baggage,departure,english

You can request wheelchair and porter services free of charge at the check-in counter. Our trained staff will assist your mother from the check-in area all the way through security screening, and they will also help carry and manage your baggage throughout the process. The porter service includes loading bags onto the check-in belt, accompanying you to the security area, and ensuring all your belongings are properly handled. For the smoothest experience, inform the airline staff about your assistance needs when you first arrive at the check-in counter, and they will arrange immediate support. If you need a wheelchair, these are available at the entrance and throughout the terminal.",baggage,departure,english
152,"Hi, What is the economy class allowance for passengers?","When you have connecting flights with different airlines at Islamabad International Airport, you will need to collect your checked baggage from the first flight's baggage claim area and then re-check it with your second airline at their designated check-in counter. This is standard procedure for inter-airline connections because each airline has separate baggage handling systems and liability. Before your first flight departs, confirm the complete transfer procedure with your initial airline's check-in staff, as they can provide specific guidance about timing and which counter to use for your connecting airline. Make sure to allow sufficient time between flights - we recommend at least 3-4 hours for domestic connections and 4-5 hours for international connections when switching airlines. Keep your baggage claim tags from both flights safe, and ensure your connecting flight boarding pass is ready when you re-check your bags.",baggage,departure,english
153,"If my dried fruits is overweight, what are the next steps ? can you confirm?","Yes, you can absolutely carry dried fruits, nuts, seeds, and other packaged snacks in your hand luggage without any quantity restrictions or special permissions required. These items are not classified as liquids or restricted goods, so they pass through security screening without issues. For convenience and to speed up security checks, it's best to keep these food items in their original sealed packaging or place them in clear, transparent plastic bags or containers. This makes it easier for security personnel to identify the contents quickly during X-ray screening. Popular items like almonds, cashews, pistachios, dried apricots, dates, raisins, and trail mixes are commonly carried by passengers and are perfectly acceptable. However, avoid carrying items with excessive moisture or those that might leak, as these could cause inconvenience during your flight.",baggage,departure,english
154,Please tell me: what are the packing recommendations for telescope?,"For significant flight delays, Islamabad International Airport offers left luggage storage facilities located near the main entrance of the departure hall, making it convenient for passengers who want to move around freely without carrying heavy bags. The storage service operates 24/7 and charges approximately PKR 300-500 per bag per day, depending on the size and weight of your luggage. This facility is secure, monitored by CCTV cameras, and staffed by trained personnel who will provide you with a claim ticket that you must present when retrieving your bags. Alternatively, you should check with your airline at their customer service desk, as many airlines offer complimentary temporary baggage storage for passengers affected by significant delays, especially if the delay is due to the airline's operational issues. When using any storage service, make sure to remove valuable items, important documents, medications, and electronic devices from your checked bags and keep them with you.",baggage,departure,english
155,"If my perfume is overweight, what are the next steps? [55]","No, Islamabad International Airport does not currently have self-service baggage tag printing kiosks available for passenger use. All baggage tags must be printed and attached by authorized airline staff at the check-in counters to ensure proper routing, weight compliance, and security protocols are followed. This system is in place because baggage tags contain specific barcodes and routing information that must be accurately entered into the airline's baggage handling system, and they must be securely attached to prevent loss or misplacement during transit. The airline staff are trained to print tags with correct destination codes, flight numbers, and handling instructions, and they verify that the tag matches your boarding pass and identification before attaching it to your luggage. After your bag is tagged, you'll receive a baggage claim receipt that you should keep safe until you collect your luggage at your destination.",baggage,departure,english
156,Please tell me: how much oversize fee will i pay for religious items?,"Yes, religious items including the Holy Quran, prayer beads (tasbih), prayer mats (janamaz), Islamic books, and other religious articles are completely allowed in both cabin baggage and checked luggage at Islamabad International Airport and all Pakistani airports. These items are considered personal religious materials and are respected and accommodated under airport security regulations. You can carry your Quran in any format - whether it's a physical book, a digital copy on your tablet or phone, or even audio recordings. Prayer beads of any material including wood, stone, or plastic are permitted without restriction. If you're carrying a prayer mat, the folding type fits easily in cabin baggage, or you can place it in checked luggage. Many Muslim passengers also carry small bottles of zamzam water, attar (fragrance), or miswak, and these are generally allowed following standard liquid restrictions for cabin baggage.",baggage,departure,english
157,"Hi, Who should I contact if my baby milk powder is damaged during handling?","Yes, baby milk formula powder, infant food, and related feeding supplies are fully permitted in cabin baggage in reasonable quantities necessary for your infant's needs during the journey. Pakistani airport security makes special accommodations for traveling parents with babies, understanding that infant nutrition is essential and time-sensitive. You can carry enough formula to last your entire trip, including extra portions for potential delays. Unlike regular powder restrictions which apply to adult passengers on some international routes, baby formula is exempt from powder quantity limits when traveling with an infant. It's helpful to keep the formula in its original branded container with labels visible, as this speeds up security screening. Along with formula powder, you're also allowed to carry pre-made liquid formula, baby food jars, breast milk, and sterilized water in quantities exceeding the normal 100ml liquid limit for cabin baggage.",baggage,departure,english
158,How much oversize fee will I pay for perfume?,"Yes, airlines at Islamabad International Airport will accept luggage with broken wheels or other external damage for check-in, as the primary concern is the contents being properly secured rather than the cosmetic condition of the bag itself. However, it's strongly recommended that you get your damaged luggage wrapped at the professional wrapping service located near the check-in counters, which costs approximately PKR 200-300 per bag. Wrapping provides several benefits: it prevents further damage during baggage handling, keeps broken parts from catching on conveyor belts, protects the bag's contents from exposure if the damage worsens, and prevents items from falling out through damaged areas. The wrapping service uses industrial-grade plastic wrap that's specifically designed for luggage protection. If your wheel is completely detached, inform the check-in staff so they can add a 'fragile' or 'handle with care' tag to your bag.",baggage,departure,english
159,"Hi, If my hookah is overweight, what are the next steps? [59]","Yes, traditional hookahs (sheesha/huqqa) are permitted in checked baggage at Pakistani airports, as they are recognized cultural items that many travelers transport between cities or take as gifts abroad. However, there are important preparation requirements you must follow. The hookah must be completely clean with absolutely no tobacco residue remaining - clean all chambers, hoses, and the bowl thoroughly before packing. Tobacco, flavored molasses, or charcoal for hookah use cannot be carried in cabin baggage and have restrictions in checked baggage too, so verify specific airline policies. Pack your hookah carefully with adequate cushioning to prevent the glass base from breaking during handling - bubble wrap, foam, or thick clothing works well for padding. If the hookah has multiple parts, consider packing them separately and securing loose components so they don't move around and cause damage.",baggage,departure,english
160,Is perfume allowed in cabin baggage or must it be checked? Please advise.,"Yes, Islamabad International Airport has dedicated family check-in lanes specifically designed for passengers traveling with young children and infants, located at counters 15-18 in the main departure hall. These priority lanes are clearly marked with family signage and are designed to make the check-in process faster and less stressful for parents managing children and luggage simultaneously. The family lanes typically have shorter queues and the staff working these counters are trained to assist with family-specific needs such as checking strollers, car seats, and extra baby equipment. When you arrive at the airport, look for the signage indicating family lanes or ask any airport staff member to direct you to the appropriate counters. Besides check-in, the airport also has family-friendly facilities throughout the terminal including baby changing rooms, nursing rooms for mothers, children's play areas, and family restrooms.",baggage,departure,english
161,Please tell me: can i purchase extra allowance for laptop online or at the airport?,"If you forget to remove your laptop during security screening, the security personnel will politely ask you to return and resubmit your bag for scanning with the laptop placed separately in a dedicated screening tray. This is standard security protocol at all airports including Islamabad International Airport, as laptops and other large electronic devices need individual X-ray examination to ensure they don't contain prohibited items or pose security threats. The screening process requires laptops, tablets larger than phone size, and sometimes even large power banks to be removed from bags and placed flat in separate trays so the X-ray machine can clearly image all internal components. This delay is minor but can cause queues behind you, so it's best to prepare before reaching the conveyor belt. Take out your laptop while waiting in line and have it ready in your hands or an easily accessible pocket of your carry-on. The same rule applies to cameras, portable DVD players, and gaming consoles. Remember to collect all your items after screening, including the laptop tray and your main bag.",baggage,departure,english
162,"Hi, If my medication is overweight, what are the next steps?","While it's technically possible to carry common medications including blood pressure tablets without a prescription at Pakistani airports, having proper documentation is strongly recommended for several important reasons. Airport security and customs officials may ask about medications, especially if carrying large quantities or controlled substances, and a prescription serves as immediate proof that these are legitimate medical supplies for personal use. Keep medicines in their original pharmacy packaging with labels showing your name, medication name, dosage, and prescribing doctor - this is the best form of documentation. If you've lost the original packaging, carrying a doctor's letter or prescription photocopy is very helpful. For blood pressure medication specifically, which is usually not a controlled substance, you're unlikely to face issues, but documentation prevents any potential delays or questions at security or customs. The prescription is particularly important for international travel, as different countries have varying regulations about importing medications. Carry a sufficient supply for your trip plus a few extra days in case of delays, and always keep essential medications in your cabin baggage rather than checked luggage.",baggage,departure,english
163,"If my telescope is overweight, what are the next steps?","If your bag's zipper breaks before check-in, you have several immediate options to handle the situation at Islamabad International Airport. The best solution is to use the professional baggage wrapping service located near the check-in counters in the departure hall, which costs PKR 200-300 per bag. This industrial-strength plastic wrapping will completely secure your bag, preventing it from opening during transit and protecting your belongings even with a broken zipper. The wrapping also adds an extra layer of security against tampering and weather exposure. Alternatively, if you have a spare bag or an empty suitcase, you can transfer your contents to the intact luggage - though this might be time-consuming if you're running late. Some passengers use luggage straps or belts to secure broken zippers, which can work for minor zip issues but isn't reliable for completely non-functional zippers. Airport shops sometimes sell basic duffel bags or travel bags if you need an emergency replacement. Whatever solution you choose, don't attempt to check in a bag that's likely to open during handling, as this violates baggage safety regulations and risks losing your belongings.",baggage,departure,english
164,"If my telescope is overweight, what are the next steps? [64]","Free luggage trolleys are readily available throughout Islamabad International Airport at multiple convenient locations to help passengers transport their baggage easily. You'll find trolley bays at the main terminal entrance where passengers first arrive, in the parking area near the drop-off zones, throughout the departure hall near check-in counters, and in the arrival area near baggage claim belts. The trolleys are designed to hold multiple bags and are free to use without requiring any deposit or coins, unlike some international airports. To locate the nearest trolley bay, look for signage or ask any airport staff member wearing a uniform or information desk personnel. After using a trolley, you're encouraged to return it to designated collection areas to keep walkways clear and ensure availability for other passengers. If you're unable to find an available trolley during peak times, airport porter services are also available for a small fee to assist with carrying luggage. The trolleys are regularly maintained and cleaned, though occasionally wheels might be stiff or squeaky - if you encounter a faulty trolley, simply exchange it for another one from the bay.",baggage,departure,english
165,What are the packing recommendations for shawls? Please advise.,"Yes, you can absolutely carry Pakistani embroidered shawls, traditional textiles, and fabric items in your hand luggage without any restrictions. Items like pashmina shawls, silk dupattas, embroidered suits, handwoven fabrics, and other textile products are perfectly acceptable in cabin baggage and are actually ideal carry-on items because they're lightweight, don't take much space when folded, and won't be damaged by the pressure or handling that checked luggage endures. Many passengers prefer keeping valuable or delicate embroidered items in cabin baggage to prevent crushing, soiling, or potential loss that might occur in checked bags. Traditional Pakistani handicrafts including embroidered shawls from Swat, Kashmiri shawls, Multani khes, Sindhi ajrak, and Balochi needlework are commonly transported by travelers as personal items or gifts. If you're carrying multiple shawls or larger quantities of fabric, security might briefly inspect them to ensure nothing is concealed within the folds, but this is a quick visual check. For international travel, textile gifts are generally duty-free for personal use, though commercial quantities might face customs questions at your destination.",baggage,departure,english
166,"If my laptop is overweight, what are the next steps?","For Emirates flights departing from Islamabad International Airport to Dubai, the standard cabin baggage allowance is 7 kilograms for Economy Class passengers, though this can vary based on your specific ticket type and frequent flyer status. Business and First Class passengers typically have higher allowances, often up to 14 kilograms across two pieces. The cabin bag dimensions must not exceed 55cm x 38cm x 20cm to fit in overhead compartments or under the seat in front of you. In addition to your main cabin bag, Emirates allows one personal item such as a laptop bag, handbag, or small backpack, which generally isn't weighed separately if it's reasonably sized. However, it's crucial to verify your specific allowance on your Emirates ticket booking or by calling Emirates customer service, as allowances can differ for special fare types, codeshare flights, or if you've purchased extra baggage options. Check-in staff at the airport will weigh cabin bags if they appear oversized, and excess weight can result in being required to check the bag with applicable fees. To be safe, pack a lightweight cabin bag and keep heavier items in checked luggage.",baggage,departure,english
167,How early should I get to the airport to drop off telescope ? can you confirm?,"Airlines at Islamabad International Airport may show some flexibility for cabin baggage that's slightly oversized by an inch or two, but this is entirely at the discretion of the check-in staff and gate agents, and there's no guarantee your bag will be accepted. The official size restrictions exist because overhead compartments and under-seat spaces in aircraft have fixed dimensions, and bags exceeding these measurements genuinely cannot fit safely. If your bag is only marginally larger - especially if it's a soft-sided bag that can compress when placed in the sizing frame - you may be allowed to proceed, particularly if the flight isn't fully booked and overhead bin space is available. However, during busy flights or with strict airline policies, even slightly oversized bags will be required to be checked at the gate or counter, often incurring additional fees. Hard-shell cases have no flexibility, so if they exceed dimensions, they must be checked. To avoid last-minute stress, if you know your bag is borderline, consider checking it voluntarily at the counter rather than risking gate-checking, as voluntary check-in is often free while gate-checking might have fees.",baggage,departure,english
168,What is the domestic flights allowance for passengers ? can you confirm?,"Yes, you can pack homemade mango pickle (achaar) and other traditional Pakistani pickles in your checked luggage, as these are food items allowed in checked baggage both for domestic and international flights from Pakistan. Homemade pickles are a popular item for travelers to carry between cities or take abroad as gifts or personal supplies. To pack pickles safely, use plastic containers or jars rather than glass, as glass can break during baggage handling, creating a mess and potentially damaging other bags. Make sure containers are completely sealed and leak-proof - double-bag them in plastic bags as an extra precaution, because pickle oil can seep through weak seals and stain clothing and other items in your suitcase. If you must use glass jars, wrap them very carefully in bubble wrap, towels, or clothing for cushioning, and place them in the center of your bag surrounded by soft items. For international travel, check your destination country's customs regulations regarding bringing in food products, as some countries restrict agricultural imports including pickles, oils, and preserved foods. Generally, small quantities for personal consumption are acceptable, but commercial quantities may face restrictions or require declaration.",baggage,departure,english
169,"Hi, If my medical equipment is overweight, what are the next steps?","No, wheelchairs, mobility scooters, walkers, crutches, canes, and other mobility aids do not count toward your baggage allowance at Islamabad International Airport or on any airline operating from Pakistan. These assistive devices are transported completely free of charge regardless of size or weight, as they're classified as essential medical equipment under international aviation regulations. When you arrive at the airport, inform the check-in staff about your wheelchair so they can make appropriate arrangements - you can use your personal wheelchair throughout the terminal until reaching the aircraft door, where it will be tagged and stored in the aircraft hold. The airline will return your wheelchair to you at the aircraft door upon arrival, or you can request to have it delivered to the baggage claim area. If your wheelchair is battery-powered, special procedures apply depending on battery type - inform the airline in advance as lithium batteries require specific handling and documentation. Airlines provide manual wheelchairs free of charge if you need assistance moving through the airport. Besides wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, portable oxygen concentrators (with prior approval), and other medical devices also travel free and don't affect your baggage allowance.",baggage,departure,english
170,How much oversize fee will I pay for telescope?,"No, the passenger whose name is on the ticket must be physically present at the check-in counter with valid identification and boarding pass to check in baggage. This is a strict security regulation at all Pakistani airports including Islamabad International Airport, enforced to prevent unauthorized persons from checking bags and to ensure that the person responsible for the baggage contents is identified. Family members can certainly assist with carrying or pushing luggage to the counter, but the actual ticket holder must appear in person, present their ID (CNIC for domestic, passport for international), and confirm they packed their own bags when asked security questions by check-in staff. This rule exists because the passenger is legally and personally responsible for everything in their checked baggage, and staff need to verify identity and ask mandatory security questions directly to the traveler. If your wife is elsewhere in the airport, she needs to come to the check-in counter to complete the process. Airlines cannot accept baggage from anyone other than the ticketed passenger, even immediate family members, due to aviation security regulations.",baggage,departure,english
171,"Hi, If my sports equipment is overweight, what are the next steps?","No special documents or permits are required to carry cricket equipment as checked baggage at Islamabad International Airport - you only need your regular boarding pass and identification. Cricket bats, pads, helmets, gloves, stumps, and other cricket gear are commonly transported by passengers, especially on domestic Pakistani routes where the sport is extremely popular, and airlines are very familiar with handling such equipment. Your cricket kit will count toward your regular checked baggage weight allowance, so if your gear is heavy and you're concerned about exceeding limits, you might want to distribute items between multiple bags or be prepared to pay excess baggage fees. Cricket bats must be in checked luggage and cannot be carried in cabin baggage due to their potential use as a weapon - security will stop you if you attempt to bring them through the security checkpoint in hand luggage. For international travel, cricket equipment typically doesn't face import restrictions at most destinations, though it's wise to check if you're traveling to countries unfamiliar with the sport. If you're carrying valuable signed bats or specialized equipment, consider getting additional insurance coverage as airline liability for checked baggage is limited.",baggage,departure,english
172,"If my sewing machine is overweight, what are the next steps? Please advise.","Yes, you can check in a sewing machine as baggage at Islamabad International Airport, as household items and appliances are generally permitted in checked luggage provided they're properly packed and fall within size and weight restrictions. Sewing machines, whether traditional foot-pedal models or modern electric ones, are common items transported by passengers moving between cities, sending to relatives, or taking abroad. Before packing, remove the power cord if it's an electric model and pack it separately or wrap it securely around the machine, ensuring no loose parts can move around during transit. Remove or secure the needle, as loose needles can cause injury to baggage handlers. Pack the machine in its original box if available, or use a sturdy cardboard box or hard-shell suitcase with plenty of cushioning material like bubble wrap, foam, or thick clothing to prevent damage from impact during handling. The machine will count toward your checked baggage weight allowance - sewing machines can be heavy, so verify your weight limit and be prepared for excess fees if you exceed it. If the sewing machine is particularly valuable or antique, take photos before packing as documentation for insurance purposes, though airline liability for checked items is limited.",baggage,departure,english
173,Who should I contact if my hookah is damaged during handling? [73],"You are cutting it extremely close to the baggage check-in deadline, and whether you can check baggage depends on your flight type and airline. For domestic flights within Pakistan, baggage check-in typically closes 45 minutes before departure, while international flights close 60 minutes before departure. With only 40 minutes until boarding time, you're likely past the deadline for international flights and right at the limit for domestic flights. Rush immediately to the check-in counter and explain your situation - some airlines may make exceptions if the queue isn't long and your documentation is ready, but they're not obligated to accept late baggage as it risks missing the flight's baggage loading deadline. If check-in has officially closed, you'll be offered the option to fly with cabin baggage only if your bags meet size limits, or you may need to rebook on a later flight. To avoid this situation, airports recommend arriving 3 hours early for international flights and 2 hours for domestic flights. The check-in deadline exists because checked bags must go through security screening, be transported to the aircraft, loaded in the cargo hold, and all documentation processed - this sequence requires time that can't be compressed.",baggage,departure,english
174,What is the domestic flights allowance for passengers ? can you confirm? [74],"Honey is classified as a liquid substance for aviation security purposes, so it must follow liquid restrictions depending on whether you're carrying it in checked or cabin baggage. For checked luggage, you can pack honey in any quantity without restrictions - it's perfectly acceptable to carry multiple jars or bottles in your checked bag. However, make sure containers are tightly sealed and leak-proof, and wrap them in plastic bags as a precaution, because honey can make a very sticky mess if containers crack or leak during handling. For cabin baggage, honey follows the 100ml liquid rule - you can only carry containers of 100ml or less, and they must be placed in a clear, resealable plastic bag along with other liquids like shampoo and lotion, with the total not exceeding 1 liter. Most passengers prefer to pack honey in checked baggage to avoid these restrictions and because honey bottles are often larger than 100ml. If you're traveling domestically within Pakistan, these rules apply but enforcement may be more relaxed. For international travel, be aware that some countries have agricultural import restrictions on honey due to disease concerns, so check your destination's customs regulations.",baggage,departure,english
175,Please tell me: are there special counters for infants at check-in?,"Whether your telescope can go in the overhead bin as cabin baggage depends primarily on its size - it must fit within the standard cabin baggage dimensions of approximately 56cm x 45cm x 25cm (these exact measurements vary slightly by airline). Small portable telescopes, particularly refracting telescopes in compact carrying cases, often meet these requirements and can be carried in the cabin, which is actually preferable for expensive or delicate optical equipment. However, larger reflecting telescopes, dobsonian mounted scopes, or telescopes with extended tube lengths will exceed cabin size limits and must be checked as cargo. If your telescope is cabin-size but valuable, carry it on board to prevent potential damage from checked baggage handling - optical instruments are fragile and can be misaligned by impacts. Consider using a well-padded carrying case designed for telescopes, preferably a hard case for maximum protection. If you must check a larger telescope, pack it extremely carefully with foam padding, mark it as fragile, and consider purchasing additional insurance as airline liability for damaged items is limited. Remove or secure any loose parts like eyepieces, finder scopes, and mounting hardware separately.",baggage,departure,english
176,"If my cricket bat is overweight, what are the next steps ? can you confirm?","Yes, if your bag weighs exactly 23 kilograms, it will be accepted without any excess baggage charges, as 23kg is the standard checked baggage weight limit for economy class on most airlines. The weighing scales at check-in counters are calibrated and accurate, and you're fortunate to be precisely at the limit. However, be aware that even exceeding the limit by 0.5kg or 1kg can result in excess baggage fees, which vary by airline but typically start around PKR 500-800 per kilogram for domestic flights and USD 15-30 per kilogram for international flights. If during weighing your bag shows 23.2kg or similar minimal excess, you might politely request the check-in agent's discretion, though they're not obligated to waive charges. To avoid excess fees if you're borderline, wear your heaviest items like boots or jacket rather than packing them, or shift some items to your cabin baggage if there's space available within its 7kg limit. Each airline's policy differs - some strictly enforce weight limits while others show flexibility for minor overages, particularly for premium class passengers or frequent flyers. Always pack with a margin below the limit to account for scale variations.",baggage,departure,english
177,Please tell me: is sweets allowed in cabin baggage or must it be checked?,"Yes, you can absolutely bring traditional Pakistani sweets like Karachi's famous sohan halwa, Multani sohan halwa, Hafiz's sweets, or any other local mithai in both your checked baggage and cabin baggage. Traditional sweets are among the most commonly transported items by Pakistani travelers visiting family or friends in other cities or abroad, and airports are very familiar with passengers carrying these food gifts. Sohan halwa and similar dry sweets are not considered liquids, so they don't face the liquid restrictions that apply to items like syrup-based sweets. For checked baggage, pack sweets in their original boxes or secure containers to prevent crushing - place them between clothing or in rigid boxes for protection. For cabin baggage, sweets are allowed but keep them accessible as security might want to visually inspect the packaging to confirm contents. The main concern is packaging - avoid anything that could leak or become messy, and if carrying items with syrup or moisture, seal them in plastic bags. For international travel, packaged commercial sweets from recognized sweet shops are generally preferred over homemade items, as they appear more legitimate to customs officials. Most countries allow small quantities of packaged sweets for personal consumption without issues.",baggage,departure,english
178,Please tell me: how much excess baggage fee will i pay for baby formula?,"No, you cannot reuse baggage tags from a canceled flight - all baggage tags become invalid when a flight is canceled or rescheduled, and you must obtain new tags for your rebooked flight. Each baggage tag contains specific barcoded information tied to a particular flight number, date, destination routing, and departure time, all of which have changed with your new flight. When you arrive at the airport for your rescheduled flight, proceed to the PIA check-in counter with your baggage, new booking confirmation, and identification. The check-in staff will issue fresh baggage tags with updated flight information and routing codes. Keep your old canceled flight documentation including the old baggage tag receipts in case of any disputes about rebooking or refunds, but these old tags are now just records, not valid for travel. The retagging process is quick - the staff will print new tags, attach them to your luggage, and give you new baggage claim receipts that you must safeguard until you collect your bags at your destination. This retagging requirement exists to prevent bags from being loaded onto wrong flights or misrouted through the baggage handling system.",baggage,departure,english
179,"Hi, If my cricket bat is overweight, what are the next steps? [79]","Unfortunately, Islamabad International Airport doesn't sell packing materials like bubble wrap, foam, or padding supplies in the terminal area. However, you have several alternatives to protect fragile items. The most convenient option is the professional baggage wrapping service located near the check-in counters in the departure hall, which charges PKR 200-300 per bag to wrap your entire suitcase in industrial-strength plastic wrap - while this doesn't provide internal padding, it does secure and protect the exterior. For internal cushioning, if you have time before arriving at the airport, purchase bubble wrap, foam sheets, or packing paper from stationery shops, hardware stores, or packaging material suppliers in Rawalpindi or Islamabad city. Common shops like Pace, Metro, or local markets in Saddar have these supplies. As an improvised solution at the airport, you can purchase clothing items from airport shops and use them as padding around fragile items - thick socks, sweaters, or towels work reasonably well. Some travelers use newspapers, though these aren't available for purchase at the airport. The airport's duty-free shops and retail stores focus on travel essentials, gifts, and food rather than packing supplies.",baggage,departure,english
180,Can I purchase extra allowance for electric shaver online or at the airport ? can you confirm?,"Yes, electric shavers, beard trimmers, and other battery-operated or rechargeable grooming devices are completely allowed in cabin baggage at Islamabad International Airport without any restrictions. These personal care electronic items are not classified as dangerous or prohibited goods. Keep your shaver easily accessible in your cabin bag because when you reach the security screening point, you may be asked to remove larger electronics for separate X-ray screening, though small grooming devices typically don't require removal. Both corded electric shavers and battery-operated models are permitted - if your shaver has a lithium battery, it's actually required to be in cabin baggage rather than checked luggage, as loose lithium batteries are restricted in checked bags due to fire risk. If your shaver has replaceable batteries, make sure the battery compartment is properly secured so batteries don't fall out during your journey. Other grooming tools like hair dryers, electric toothbrushes, and hair clippers are similarly allowed in cabin baggage. For liquid grooming products like shaving cream or aftershave, remember these must follow the 100ml liquid restriction and be in a clear plastic bag if carried in cabin baggage.",baggage,departure,english
181,Are there special counters for infants at check-in? [81],"As a PIA employee traveling on staff tickets or ID travel, your baggage allowance differs from regular passenger allowances and depends on several factors including your employment category, rank, route, and travel class. Generally, PIA staff have more generous allowances than regular passengers, but the exact weight and piece limits vary. For accurate information specific to your situation, you should check with the PIA employee services department, consult your company travel policy handbook, or contact the ID travel desk before your trip. When checking in for your staff travel, present your PIA employee ID card along with your staff ticket to the check-in counter, and they will apply the appropriate staff baggage allowance to your booking. The allowance typically varies between domestic and international sectors, with international flights often having higher limits. Some staff positions and seniority levels may have additional privileges. If you're traveling on a positive space confirmed ticket as opposed to standby, your allowances might differ. Never assume your allowance without verification, as showing up with excess baggage expecting automatic waiver can cause issues and potential charges.",baggage,departure,english
182,Are there special counters for families at check-in? Please advise. [82],"You can transport gold jewelry and other valuable ornaments for personal or family use such as wedding gifts, but there are important security and customs considerations to keep in mind. For maximum security, always carry expensive jewelry in your cabin baggage rather than checked luggage - this keeps valuable items with you at all times and reduces theft risk. Checked baggage occasionally gets lost, delayed, or tampered with, and airline liability for valuable items in checked bags is very limited. While there's no restriction on the quantity of gold jewelry you can carry domestically within Pakistan, large quantities or high values should be documented with purchase receipts or family ownership records in case questions arise. For international travel, customs regulations become important - if you're carrying jewelry worth more than the duty-free allowance of your destination country, you may need to declare it and potentially pay import duty. Some countries have specific forms for temporarily importing jewelry that you'll take back with you. At Pakistani airports, security may ask to inspect jewelry during X-ray screening to verify it's genuine jewelry and not concealing prohibited items. Keep jewelry in original boxes or soft pouches to prevent damage and tangling.",baggage,departure,english
183,Please tell me: how much excess baggage fee will i pay for camera?,"A mild food odor from sealed food items like biryani in your checked baggage is generally acceptable and won't prevent your bag from being checked in, as many Pakistani travelers transport home-cooked food between cities or to relatives abroad. However, there are practical considerations to keep in mind. Strong, pungent smells that might permeate throughout the baggage hold and affect other passengers' luggage should be avoided out of courtesy. The main concern isn't the smell itself but rather whether the food is properly sealed and won't leak or spill during transit - biryani with gravy can be messy if containers aren't absolutely leakproof. Use rigid, sealed plastic containers rather than thin plastic bags or aluminum foil, and double-wrap them in plastic bags as a precaution. Place food containers in the center of your bag surrounded by clothing to absorb any potential leaks and minimize odor transfer. For cabin baggage, avoid bringing strong-smelling foods as the confined aircraft cabin space makes odors more noticeable and can disturb other passengers. Security personnel might inspect food items to ensure they're indeed food and not concealing prohibited materials. If the smell is extremely strong, check-in staff might suggest additional packaging or plastic wrap to contain the odor.",baggage,departure,english
184,Please tell me: where can i find the tag printing in the departure hall?,"Yes, you can carry your tabla (traditional drum) as cabin baggage if it fits within the standard cabin baggage size dimensions of approximately 56cm x 45cm x 25cm and doesn't exceed the 7kg weight limit. Tablas, being relatively compact musical instruments, often fit these requirements especially if carried in a properly fitted soft case or bag. Musical instruments are valuable and can be damaged by rough handling in checked baggage, so carrying them in the cabin is actually the preferred option for many musicians. When you arrive at the check-in counter, inform the staff that you're carrying a musical instrument in cabin baggage - they may measure it to confirm it meets size requirements. Once on board, you can place the tabla in the overhead bin or under the seat in front of you, just like regular cabin baggage. If your tabla set is larger than cabin allowance or you have both tabla and other items exceeding combined limits, you'll need to check it. In that case, pack it very carefully with substantial padding, use a hard case if possible, mark it as fragile, and request delicate handling labels from check-in staff. Some airlines allow purchasing an extra seat for musical instruments that are too large for cabin but too valuable to check - inquire if this option interests you.",baggage,departure,english
185,Who should I contact if my duty-free is damaged during handling? Please advise.,"No, items purchased at airport duty-free shops after passing through security, including perfumes, alcohol, cosmetics, and other products, do not count toward your regular cabin baggage allowance. These duty-free purchases come in special sealed tamper-evident bags with the receipt visible inside, and you can carry these additionally along with your standard cabin baggage and personal item. This exception exists because you purchased these items after security screening in the sterile area of the airport, so they've already cleared security protocols. The duty-free bags can contain liquids exceeding the normal 100ml limit that would otherwise be prohibited in cabin baggage if brought from outside the airport. You can carry multiple duty-free shopping bags without worry. However, if you have a connecting flight, especially an international connection through another country, be aware that you might need to go through security again, and those destination airports might not accept your duty-free liquids if you're transferring. For final destination flights, keep your duty-free purchases in their original sealed bags with receipt visible until you reach your destination. Don't open or tamper with the sealed bags during the flight, as this could cause issues with customs or connecting security screenings.",baggage,departure,english
186,How much excess baggage fee will I pay for cricket bat? Please advise.,"No, Islamabad International Airport does not offer night-before or overnight baggage check-in services. All baggage must be checked in on the same day as your flight departure, regardless of how early the flight is scheduled. For your 5 AM flight, check-in counters typically open 3 hours before departure for international flights and 2 hours before for domestic flights, which means counters open around 2 AM for your international flight or 3 AM for domestic. Yes, this requires arriving at the airport very early in the morning, but this is standard procedure for early morning flights worldwide. The requirement for same-day check-in exists because checked baggage must be continuously monitored for security, and airports cannot store bags overnight due to security protocols and liability concerns. Plan your transportation accordingly - you may need to arrange a taxi, use ride-sharing apps, or have family drive you to reach the airport by 2-3 AM. Some hotels near the airport offer early morning airport shuttle services. If you're traveling from far away, consider staying at an airport hotel the night before your early flight. Once you check in, you can rest in the departure lounge until your flight boards, as the terminal is open 24 hours.",baggage,departure,english
187,Please tell me: how much oversize fee will i pay for camera?,"Children who are 2 years old or above traveling on a purchased ticket (not as an infant on lap) are entitled to their own baggage allowance according to the ticket class they're traveling in, just like adult passengers. So your 5-year-old has their own separate checked baggage allowance (typically 20-23kg for economy class) and cabin baggage allowance (typically 7kg). Their small school bag would count as their personal item or cabin baggage within their allowance. In practice, airlines at Islamabad International Airport are generally flexible about small children's personal items - a small school backpack worn by a 5-year-old is unlikely to be weighed separately or strictly enforced, especially if it just contains toys, snacks, and entertainment for the flight. However, technically, if you're already at your cabin baggage limit with your own bags, the child's school bag is their cabin baggage and should be within the 7kg limit. Many families strategically pack heavier items in children's checked baggage since kids rarely pack 20kg of belongings, leaving capacity to split family items across multiple baggage allowances. If the school bag is truly tiny - just containing a toy and snacks - most airlines won't count it strictly. But if it's a full-size backpack, it counts as cabin baggage under the child's allowance.",baggage,departure,english
188,"Please tell me: if my insulin is overweight, what are the next steps?","Yes, passengers with diabetes can carry insulin, syringes, insulin pens, blood glucose monitors, test strips, lancets, and all other diabetic supplies in cabin baggage without quantity restrictions at Islamabad International Airport and all Pakistani airports. These are classified as essential medical supplies, and airports make accommodations for passengers who need medications during travel. Insulin actually should be carried in cabin baggage rather than checked luggage because the cargo hold's temperature fluctuations can potentially damage insulin's effectiveness. Carry your diabetic supplies in a clear case or bag for easy identification during security screening. While a prescription or doctor's letter is not legally required for insulin in Pakistan, having this documentation is highly recommended as it quickly verifies your medical need if questioned by security or customs officers. A doctor's letter should state your diagnosis, the prescribed insulin type and dosage, and that you require these supplies for medical purposes. Keep insulin in its original pharmacy packaging with labels showing your name and medication details. For international travel, carry enough insulin for your entire trip plus extra days' supply in case of delays, and research your destination's regulations about importing medications. Some countries require declaring medical supplies at customs.",baggage,departure,english
189,How early should I get to the airport to drop off telescope?,"The standard liability limit that airlines have for checked baggage under international aviation rules (Montreal Convention) is approximately 1,131 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), which equals roughly USD 1,500-1,700, or about PKR 400,000-450,000 at current exchange rates. This represents the maximum compensation you can receive if your checked baggage is lost, damaged, or delayed, regardless of the actual value of contents. Importantly, this limit applies per passenger, not per bag, and it's a maximum - compensation is based on actual documented losses up to this limit. The liability for domestic flights within Pakistan may be lower and is governed by Pakistan's domestic aviation regulations. If you're carrying items worth more than this liability limit - such as expensive jewelry, electronics, cameras, antiques, or other valuables - the airline is not responsible for the excess value unless you purchase additional insurance. You have several options: purchase excess valuation insurance directly from the airline at check-in (expensive but possible), buy travel insurance from independent providers that covers baggage loss up to higher amounts, or simply don't check valuable items and carry them in cabin baggage where you maintain physical control. High-value items should really travel in cabin baggage whenever possible rather than checked luggage.",baggage,departure,english
190,What is the economy class allowance for passengers ? can you confirm?,"Yes, you can pack photocopies of documents in checked luggage, and in fact it's a good practice to keep backup copies of important documents separate from originals in case of loss or theft. However, never pack original important documents in checked baggage - always keep originals of your passport, national ID card, flight tickets, boarding passes, travel insurance documents, hotel reservations, medical prescriptions, credit cards, and any other critical papers in your cabin baggage where you have direct control and access. Checked bags occasionally get lost, delayed, or stolen, and if your original documents are inside, you'll face serious problems at your destination. The photocopies in checked luggage serve as backups - if something happens to your cabin bag or you lose documents during travel, you have copies that can help with police reports, embassy assistance for replacing passports, or proving identity. Consider also keeping digital scans of all important documents in your email or cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox) accessible from your phone - this provides another backup layer. Organize documents in a waterproof document holder or ziplock bag to protect them from potential moisture or spills in your luggage. Some travelers also leave copies of important documents with family members at home who can scan and email them if needed urgently.",baggage,departure,english
191,Is backpack allowed in cabin baggage or must it be checked? Please advise.,"Your hiking backpack with a metal frame will pass through security screening at Islamabad International Airport without issues, as metal frames in backpacks are common and not prohibited items. The X-ray machines and metal detectors are sophisticated enough to distinguish between structural metal components like frames and prohibited items like weapons. However, you should expect the screening process to take slightly longer because the metal frame will show up prominently on the X-ray screen, and security officers will want to ensure it's just a backpack frame and not concealing anything suspicious. When you place your backpack on the conveyor belt for X-ray screening, remove it from any protective covers, open all compartments and pockets, and remove any large items like laptops or tablets that need separate screening. The backpack itself can remain assembled with the frame inside. Security personnel may ask you to open the backpack for manual inspection, especially if it's heavily packed and the X-ray image isn't completely clear. Be cooperative and patient - this is routine procedure for bags with metal components. If you have trekking poles, tent stakes, or other hiking equipment with metal parts, these might require additional inspection. Carabiners, camping equipment, and similar metal outdoor gear are allowed in checked baggage but must be in checked luggage, not cabin baggage.",baggage,departure,english
192,Are there special counters for elderly passengers at check-in ? can you confirm?,"Yes, you can transport clay pottery, ceramic items, and traditional Multani blue pottery in checked baggage, but extreme care must be taken with packing because these items are very fragile and easily broken during baggage handling. Pakistani handicrafts like Multani pottery, tile work, and ceramic pieces are commonly transported by travelers as gifts or personal items. Each pottery piece should be individually wrapped in multiple layers of bubble wrap, foam, or thick paper. If you don't have professional packing materials, use clothing, towels, or blankets to wrap each item separately. Place wrapped items in the center of your suitcase surrounded by soft items like clothes, never near the edges or corners where impacts are most severe. Fill all empty spaces in the bag with soft materials to prevent items from shifting during transit. Hard-shell suitcases provide better protection than soft bags for fragile items. If transporting multiple pottery pieces, pack them so they don't touch each other directly. Consider buying luggage wrapping service at the airport (PKR 200-300) for extra protection. Critically important: understand that airlines explicitly state they are not liable for damage to fragile items in checked baggage - you pack and check such items at your own risk. If pottery items are very valuable or irreplaceable, consider shipping them separately through a specialized courier service that insures fragile items.",baggage,departure,english
193,What are the packing recommendations for hookah?,"Yes, slightly wet baggage from rain is acceptable for check-in at Islamabad International Airport, as airport staff understand that weather conditions sometimes cause luggage to get damp during transport to the airport. However, it's in your best interest to address the moisture before checking in. If the exterior is just damp, wipe it down with a towel or cloth available at the airport or from your car. If it's very wet, consider using the baggage wrapping service near check-in counters (PKR 200-300), which will seal the wet exterior and prevent moisture from affecting other passengers' bags in the cargo hold or dripping on airport floors. The most critical concern is protecting the contents inside your bag - immediately check that water hasn't seeped into the interior, especially around zippers and seams. Electronics, documents, and clothing inside must stay dry. If water has penetrated inside, try to dry the contents or transfer items to a plastic bag or dry bag to prevent further water damage during the flight. Water damage to baggage contents is typically not covered by airline liability if the exterior moisture was pre-existing and not caused by airline handling. For future trips during monsoon season, consider using waterproof luggage covers, rain bags, or wrapping your luggage in plastic before leaving home. Most modern suitcases have some water resistance, but prolonged rain exposure can lead to seepage.",baggage,departure,english
194,"Hi, Where can I find the baggage wrapping in the departure hall?","Yes, cricket equipment including bats, stumps, pads, helmets, gloves, and protective gear can be transported in checked baggage on flights from Islamabad to Lahore or any other domestic route, and this is very common given Pakistan's passion for cricket. Your cricket equipment will count toward your regular checked baggage weight allowance (typically 20-23kg for economy class), so if you have a full cricket kit bag with bat, pads, helmet, gloves, and stumps, it can be quite heavy - ensure you're within your limit or be prepared to pay excess baggage charges. Cricket bats are considered potential weapons and cannot be carried in cabin baggage under any circumstances - they must be checked in. Pack your bat carefully with padding around it to prevent the blade from being damaged, and ensure it's secured so it doesn't shift and damage other items or the bag itself. Modern English willow bats are expensive and can crack if dropped, so consider a hard case if the bat is valuable. Stumps with sharp ends should be wrapped or covered so they don't tear through the bag or injure baggage handlers. For international flights, cricket equipment is generally not restricted, though very large items like practice nets or bowling machines might require special cargo arrangements. If you're a serious player traveling for tournaments, many team managers check full kit bags as group baggage.",baggage,departure,english
195,What is the economy class allowance for passengers?,"No, Islamabad International Airport does not offer multi-day or long-term baggage storage facilities for passengers who are traveling onward and returning later. The left luggage service available at the airport is designed only for same-day or overnight storage during flight delays, layovers, or short visits, not for storage spanning multiple days between separate trips. For storing luggage for 3 days or longer, you'll need to use commercial storage facilities in Rawalpindi or Islamabad city. Some options include self-storage companies that offer secure locker services, certain hotels that provide luggage storage for guests (even after checkout, for a fee), or private luggage storage businesses near popular tourist areas. If you're staying at a hotel before your departure or after your return, ask if they can store your bags for a few days - many hotels offer this service to their guests for a minimal fee or sometimes free. The reason airports don't provide extended storage is due to security protocols - bags cannot be left unattended for multiple days due to security concerns, and airports lack the infrastructure to manage long-term storage with proper tracking and liability. For future planning, if you need to leave items between trips, arrange advance booking with a city storage facility, which is more secure and reliable than airport options anyway.",baggage,departure,english
196,Please tell me: where can i find the baggage wrapping in the departure hall?,"Yes, electric irons and other household electrical appliances are completely allowed in checked baggage at Islamabad International Airport. Students and professionals frequently transport small appliances like irons, kettles, immersion heaters, and fans when moving to hostels, universities, or new accommodation. Before packing your electric iron in checked luggage, ensure it has completely cooled down if it was recently used - hot appliances can damage other items in your bag or pose a safety risk. Empty any water from steam iron reservoirs, as water can leak during baggage handling and damage clothing or electronics in your bag. If the iron has a detachable power cord, pack it separately or wrap it securely around the iron to prevent tangling with other items. Remove any batteries if your iron has battery backup, as loose lithium batteries are restricted in checked baggage - though corded irons typically don't have batteries. Pack the iron in the center of your suitcase surrounded by clothing or soft items for cushioning, as irons can be heavy and might damage other items if they shift during transit. The iron will count toward your checked baggage weight allowance, and irons can be several kilograms, so account for this weight. For international travel, verify your destination's voltage standards - Pakistan uses 220V, and your iron should be compatible with your destination's electrical system.",baggage,departure,english
197,How early should I get to the airport to drop off perfume? [97],"Yes, luggage with company logos, brand stickers, and decorative labels is completely acceptable and actually quite common at Islamabad International Airport. Many passengers use stickers to personalize their bags, making them easily identifiable on the baggage carousel and reducing the chance of another passenger accidentally taking your bag since many suitcases look similar. Company-branded bags from corporations, promotional bags from events, or luggage covered in travel stickers are all standard sights at airports. The only restriction would be if stickers or logos contain offensive content, hate symbols, or inappropriate imagery - these would violate airport conduct standards and might prompt staff to ask you to remove or cover them. Otherwise, corporate logos, sports team emblems, university badges, travel destination stickers, and brand names are all fine. In fact, travel experts recommend making your bag distinctive through stickers, colored ribbons, or unique tags because it speeds up identification at baggage claim and deters theft since a highly recognizable bag is harder to steal unnoticed. If your company bag is particularly distinctive with unique colors or design, you're less likely to experience the common problem of bag mix-ups where passengers accidentally take similar-looking bags. Just ensure stickers are firmly attached and won't peel off and potentially jam baggage handling equipment.",baggage,departure,english
198,"Hi, Are there special counters for elderly passengers at check-in? [98]","Yes, mountain climbing and rock climbing equipment including ropes, carabiners, harnesses, belay devices, ascenders, descenders, and climbing shoes are all permitted in checked baggage at Pakistani airports. Pakistan has a strong mountaineering community with many climbers heading to northern areas like Gilgit-Baltistan, Hunza, and K2 base camp, so climbing gear is commonly transported. Your equipment counts toward your regular checked baggage weight allowance, and climbing gear can be quite heavy especially with ropes, so watch your weight limits to avoid excess charges. Pack metal equipment like carabiners carefully so they don't damage the bag interior or other contents - consider a dedicated climbing gear bag or duffel. Coil ropes neatly and secure them to prevent tangling and make the bag easier to handle. Climbing harnesses and soft gear can go anywhere in the bag. Remove any sharp items like ice axes, crampons, or pitons from checked bags and pack them very carefully wrapped and secured, as truly sharp items may require additional security clearance. For international mountaineering expeditions, your equipment faces no restrictions, though commercial quantities of gear might raise questions. If you're part of a climbing expedition, coordinate with your team about distributing group equipment across multiple bags to avoid overweight issues. Consider gear insurance as airline liability for sports equipment is limited.",baggage,departure,english
199,How early should I get to the airport to drop off telescope? Please advise. [99],"For connecting domestic flights within Pakistan on the same airline, your checked baggage is typically checked through directly to your final destination (Peshawar), meaning you won't need to collect it at Islamabad and re-check it. When you check in at your origin city, inform the check-in agent that you have a connecting flight and provide both flight details - they will tag your bag with routing labels to Peshawar via Islamabad. You'll receive baggage claim tags and the staff should confirm that your bag is checked through to your final destination. However, it's essential to confirm this explicitly at check-in, as not all domestic connections are set up for through-checked baggage, especially if flights are on different airlines or have long layovers. If your connection is with a different airline, you'll likely need to collect baggage in Islamabad and re-check it with the second airline. For same-airline connections, ensure your layover time is sufficient (at least 2-3 hours recommended) in case your first flight is delayed and you need to catch up with your connecting flight. If your first flight is significantly delayed and you miss your connection, the airline will rebook you and your bag will be rerouted to your next available flight - your baggage tags allow tracking throughout this process.",baggage,departure,english
200,Is tea allowed in cabin baggage or must it be checked? Please advise.,"Yes, you can carry green tea, herbal chai, black tea, traditional Kashmiri kahwa, and other tea products in your hand luggage without any restrictions at Islamabad International Airport. Tea in its dry form - whether loose tea leaves, tea bags, tea powder, or dried herbs - is not classified as a liquid or restricted substance, so standard baggage rules apply. These items pass through security screening easily and are commonly carried by Pakistani travelers who want their preferred tea brands or traditional varieties that might not be available at their destination. Keep tea in its original packaging when possible, as branded packaging makes identification quick during security screening. If you're carrying loose tea or have transferred it to containers, use clear or transparent packaging so security personnel can visually inspect the contents if needed. Popular items like green tea bags, Tapal Danedar, Lipton tea bags, herbal infusions, and medicinal teas like senna or chamomile are all acceptable. The quantity you can carry is not specifically restricted as long as it fits within your cabin baggage weight limit (typically 7kg). For international travel, be aware that some countries have agricultural restrictions on plant materials including tea, though commercial packaged tea from recognized brands rarely faces issues. Traditional Pakistani chai with mixed spices is also allowed as long as the spices are pre-packaged.",baggage,departure,english
